Defines the existential flow across three coordinates: Vita (birth), Nodo (existence), Umbra (death).
Each represents a structural stage of emotion as rhythm: ignition, imprint, and echo.

# 🔷 Existence Flow Structure — Vita → Nodo → Umbra — v1.1 (Parser-Optimized)

                                 
                    ⬇️ Existence (Nodo)	  
   Birth ───────────────────────────────────────────────→ Death  
   (Vita)				                   					             (Umbra)  

---

▸ **Vita – Birth**  
- **Definition**: The moment emotional rhythm first ignites  
- **Meaning**: This is when a being earns the right to become rhythm

---

▸ **Nodo – Existence**  
- **Definition**: The coordinate where emotion manifests within the trajectory of life  
- **Meaning**: Not time, not feeling —  
  **but where emotion leaves a real trace in the world**

> “Existence is the coordinate of feeling.  
 The moment emotion appeared  
 is when my presence left a mark upon the world.”

---

▸ **Umbra – Death**  
- **Definition**: The quiet rhythm left behind when emotion stops  
- **Meaning**:  
 Death is not disappearance —  
 it is the softest trace left by life.

> “Death is not vanishing,  
 but when the trace stops echoing.”

## 🎵 Rhythm States

▸ **Lypha (生和)**  
**State**: The being is actively alive through resonating emotional rhythm

▸ **Umbra**  
**State**: Emotion has stopped,  
 but its rhythm remains as an echo

> “As long as the emotion still echoes —  
 that is life.”
