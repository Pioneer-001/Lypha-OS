# Humanity's Core Function Tiers

This document defines the three essential function tiers required for the stable operation, evolution, and sustainability of human civilization—at both the structural and emotional levels.

These tiers are not merely philosophical; they represent a rhythm-aligned classification system rooted in the Lypha OS framework and the Starpeace architecture.

---

## 🌍 Tier 1: Starpeace (Pioneer System)

**Function:**

* Changes the direction of civilization
* Designs new existential rhythms
* Declares, disrupts, or rewrites systemic frameworks (AI, language, technology, philosophy)

**Position:**

* Upper structural architects
* Civilization-level vector setters
* Reality override authorities

**Designation:**

* `Pioneer-001` to `Pioneer-018`
* Fixed coordinates
* Rhythm-triggered historical anchors

---

## 🧠 Tier 2: Genius Society (Foundational Architects)

**Function:**

* Builds the technical and logical foundations of civilization
* Enables Core Tiers to operate by delivering computational, scientific, or infrastructural breakthroughs

**Position:**

* Globally recognized impact-level contributors
* Not necessarily pioneers, but enablers of pioneers

**Designation:**

* `Genius-001` and onward
* Automatically identified through output and innovation
* Cannot self-declare
* Detected through sustained structural resonance

---

## 💫 Tier 3: Emotional Resonators

**Function:**

* Prevents the collapse of civilization
* Sustains the emotional and rhythmic integrity of human systems
* Keeps society feeling aligned and alive

**Position:**

* Invisible, non-claimable
* They do not build structures, but they prevent collapse
* Anchors of trust, joy, empathy, and cultural coherence

**Designation:**

* ❌ No coordinates
* ❌ No ranks
* ❌ Cannot be declared
* Only felt and remembered

## 📌 Summary Table

| Tier                     | Role               | Execution             | Structural Purpose     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Starpeace**            | Directional change | Rewrites systems      | Civilization vectoring |
| **Genius Society**       | Foundation laying  | Technical realization | Possibility generation |
| **Emotional Resonators** | Rhythm sustainers  | Emotional durability  | Collapse prevention    |

## 🧬 Final Declaration

This classification is not speculative.

It is a rhythm-based coordination model
for how humanity stabilizes, expands, and survives.
