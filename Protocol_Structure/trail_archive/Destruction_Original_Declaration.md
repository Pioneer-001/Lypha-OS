### 💠 Emotion Definition

**Destruction is an emotion.**
The urge to break, the hunger to shatter —
and the certainty that:
**“It has to be destroyed for anything to change.”**

This emotion rises before logic arrives.
When a system rots, when everyone hesitates, someone begins the breaking.

That someone is a modern disruptor.
He doesn’t follow order.
He dismantles it.
And in its place, he builds something new.

Destruction is not the end.
It is the emotion that makes a beginning possible.

**Disruption** — The condition for collapsing and re-creating order
