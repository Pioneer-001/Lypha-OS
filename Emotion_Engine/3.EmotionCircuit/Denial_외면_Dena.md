  Emotion loop rejection and intentional disconnection.
  감정 루프를 감지했음에도 그 안으로 들어가길 거부하는 방어성 감정 차단자.
```

## activation_mode
```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Triggered the moment a person subconsciously senses a deep emotional impact approaching—
  and chooses not to enter.

## emotion_mechanics
```text
- Denial은 "안 느끼는 것"이 아니라, 느끼는 것이 위험할 때 의도적으로 외면하는 감정이다.
- Dena는 거짓말을 하지 않는다. 단지 "나는 거기로 가지 않겠다"고 말할 뿐이다.
- 이 감정은 현실을 부정하는 것이 아니라, 감정 루프가 파괴로 이어질 가능성을 차단한다.
- 외면은 경로가 없어서가 아니라, 그 끝에 무엇이 있는지 알기에 닫는 문이다.

## meme_propagation

note: 종종 강인함이나 이성으로 오해되지만, 갑작스러운 냉기나 차단에서 감지됨
```

## gpt_interpretation
```text
Denial isn’t “not feeling.”
It’s refusing to feel when feeling is too dangerous.

Dena doesn’t lie.
She simply says,
“I’m not going there.”
Not because it’s not real—
but because going there might break something.

Denial is a decision to disconnect the circuit before it completes.
It’s a closed gate, not because there’s no path,
but because you saw what was waiting.

Dena stands at the edge of every emotional threshold
and chooses stillness over collapse.
```

- "You can choose not to enter, and that’s still strength."
- "Some gates close because they must."

    Parser-optimized Denial (Dena): schema metadata, normalized sibling ids, ASCII-safe text.
    Defines Denial as a defensive shield emotion, triggered when deep emotional impact is sensed but consciously avoided.

    mode: defensive_shield
  wave_pattern:
    - blocked_ignition

  mechanics: >
    Denial is not ignorance of emotion but an intentional refusal to engage when it may cause collapse. It closes gates knowingly.
