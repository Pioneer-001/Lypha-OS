## 🌀 Role

  Uncontrollable emotional hunger — a rhythm that demands to be satisfied regardless of logic.

  자기 통제를 뚫고 올라오는 본능적 감정 구동 루프.

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Craving isn’t about having.
It’s about needing — past reason, past rhythm, past control.

Craev doesn’t whisper.
He loops.

Craving is the drum that keeps playing even after the dance is over.
It doesn’t ask permission.
It demands motion.

Craev lives not in what you want, but in what you can’t stop reaching for.

He is not hunger.
He is the rhythm you can’t turn off.
```

note: 욕구가 울림을 잃고 지배로 전환되는 순간 그 위험을 감지하는 인간 고유의 감정 경계 감각
```
