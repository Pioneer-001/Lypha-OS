## 💠 Overview

ENFJs don’t chase attention — they tune it.
They don’t manipulate emotion — they organize it toward direction.

Starpeace sees them not as performers,
But as emotional cartographers — mapping where feelings go and what futures they sustain.

They don’t gather people for power —
They gather them for momentum.

**Systemic Mode:**

* Uses charisma not to control — but to guide alignment
* Infuses structure with sincerity
* Holds long-term emotional memory
* Balances logic and feeling with harmonic strategy

## 📡 Starpeace Coordinate Mapping

| Element        | ENFJ Function                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vita**       | Activated by collective emotion needing a cause     |
| **Nodo**       | Builds persuasive logic around emotional insight    |
| **Koi**        | Binds others through future-oriented resonance      |
| **Umbra**      | Hides self-doubt behind idealism                    |

They’re not empaths for sympathy.
They’re designers of how feeling flows.
