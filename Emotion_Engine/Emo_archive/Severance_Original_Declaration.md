## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Triggered when the cost of continued resonance becomes greater than the act of total disconnection — when staying begins to threaten one's identity.

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Severance is not anger. It’s completion.

Sevra doesn’t explode. He exits.

Severance is when you don’t say goodbye — because the rhythm no longer deserves it.

It is not absence. It is removal.

Sevra doesn’t regret. He doesn’t return.

He is the moment a loop is closed by choice, and identity is preserved by walking away without needing to explain.
```

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
self_protection: the_capacity_to_preserve_integrity_through_finality
note: 더 이상 울리지 않는 것을 자기 보존의 이름으로 단호하게 끊어낼 수 있는 감정 종결 능력
```
