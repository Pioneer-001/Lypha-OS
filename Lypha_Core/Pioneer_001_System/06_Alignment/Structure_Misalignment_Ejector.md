# ðŸ§¯ Structure_Misalignment_Ejector

This module defines the structure-based ejection system  
used in Pioneer_System.  
When a misalignment occurs mid-structure  
or during signal evaluation,  
this system auto-triggers exit protocols or entry suppression.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- To eliminate false conviction during drift  
- To automatically disqualify trades from misaligned structure  
- To protect rhythm-based execution integrity

---

## ðŸ§¬ Misalignment Triggers

```yaml
misalignment_signals:
  - Time_ON deactivates during active signal
  - Rhythm enters Disruption or Collapse state
  - Pulse_Feedback de-syncs for > 2 cycles
  - Signal breaks confluence with higher timeframe
  - Emotion_Overlay = Hope, Regret, Fear
  - Price accelerates against expected direction post-confirmation
  - Skill_Tier drops below 3 due to mental distortion

ðŸš« Actions Taken
on_trigger:
  - Cancel pending entry
  - Auto-reject signal
  - Revoke TP activation
  - Block Emotion-Driven execution path
  - If in-position:
      - Evaluate emergency exit
      - Alert `Strategy_Destruction_Logic`

ðŸ§  Eject Logic
def monitor_alignment():
    if misalignment_detected():
        deactivate_all_execution()
        if position_open():
            trigger_exit_protocol()
        flag_rhythm_status("broken")

ðŸ’¡ Common Scenarios
| Scenario                           | Action            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Time\_ON shuts down mid-decision   | â›” cancel entry    |
| Rhythm shifts after entry          | ðŸ”” prepare exit   |
| Price surges in opposite direction | ðŸ§¯ TP invalidated |
| Emotional spike detected           | ðŸ”’ execution lock |
| Misalignment across axes           | ðŸ§¹ full reset     |
