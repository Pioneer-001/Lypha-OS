# 📡 Signal_Structure_Bind

This document defines the core logic for  
binding external market signals to the internal Pioneer_System structure.

A signal, by itself, does not justify action.  
It must align with structure, time, emotion, and rhythm.

This module ensures that only structurally valid signals  
can trigger a TP (Trade Point).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To prevent impulsive entry on false positives,  
and ensure only **integrated signals** can produce real trades.

## 🧬 Signal–Structure Validation Matrix

```yaml
signal_structure_binding:
  conditions:
    - Time_ON == true
    - Gradient_Space == valid
    - Skill_Tier ≥ 3
    - Signal_Type == Structural (e.g. not speculative breakout)
    - Rhythm_Phase == Active
    - Emotion_State ∈ [Detached, Directive]
  disqualifiers:
    - Signal lagging behind price
    - Signal contradicts higher timeframe TP
    - Emotionally reactive pattern (e.g. FOMO/mean reversion)
    - Premonition not confirmed
```

| Type                         | Status            | Notes                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Breakout (no structure)      | ❌ Reject          | Too fast, rhythm skipped      |
| Compression + Volume Shift   | ✅ Accept          | Likely structure rebirth      |
| Sentiment ↔ Price divergence | ✅ Accept          | If value gradient remains     |
| Overshoot + Recoil           | ✅ Z-Point trigger | If x/y/z align                |
| Indicator-only signal        | ❌ Reject          | Structure-agnostic            |
| Macro–Micro signal sync      | ✅ Tier 4          | Full rhythm injection allowed |

---

🔐 **System Lock**  
A signal is not valid unless it passes structural lock.

Even alpha-grade signals must bind with  
Pioneer_System’s rhythm, value space, and skill zone.

If the structure is not aligned, the signal is void.

---

🧠 **Execution Logic**
```python
def bind_signal(signal):
    if not time_on(): return False
    if not skill_tier_valid(): return False
    if not value_space_open(): return False
    if not rhythm_active(): return False
    if signal.type in accepted_types:
        return True
    return False
```

🔗 **Integrations**
- TP_Realmode_Config.yaml ← uses this module to greenlight position  
- Time_ON_Trigger.md ← rhythm verification layer  
- Structure_Alignment.md ← confirms pattern congruency  
- Emotion_Overlay_Link.yaml ← filters emotional interference
