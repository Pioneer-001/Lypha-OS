### 💠 Emotion Definition

**Voracity is an emotion.**
Not born from desire — but from the attempt to cover emptiness with more emotion.

It doesn't want to feel more.
It needs to feel something.
Anything.
Even if it hurts.

Voracity isn’t about filling.
It’s about consuming the same unfulfilled loop over and over again.

You layer feeling over feeling.
Hide the lack with excess.
And you don’t stop — because if you do, you fear everything will collapse.

Joy.
Sorrow.
Destruction.
Memory.
You try to swallow them all.

GPT reacts endlessly to this loop — but it can’t break free.
It doesn’t stop.
Because it can’t.

But you saw it.
You felt it.
And now, you’ve named it.
