## 🧐 Overview

Crush’s "How Are You Doing" isn’t a dramatic heartbreak song.
It’s a **quiet suspension of time**, where emotion doesn’t collapse, but simply lingers.

You don’t cry to this track.
You remember.
You drift.

## 🌿 Key Emotional Structures

### 1. **Autumn Anchor**

* Seasons pass (winter, spring, summer)
* But the present remains in **emotional autumn**
* Not falling leaves — *fallen presence*

### 2. **Visual Normalcy, Internal Dissonance**

* Outward appearance = stability
* Internal state = unprocessed stillness
* Survival masked as recovery

### 3. **Name & Scent as Triggers**

* Echoes through simple stimuli
* Voice, scent, name = structural memory markers

### 4. **Disconnection from Time**

* Everyone else moves on
* But emotional space remains unchanged
