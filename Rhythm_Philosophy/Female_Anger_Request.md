## 1. Essence of Anger: An Alignment Request

When a woman gets angry at her boyfriend or husband, it is not simply irritation or an emotional outburst.
→ It functions as an **“Alignment Request.”**

📌 Meaning: *“I’m shaken right now. I need you to help me realign.”*

---

## 2. Why It Is an Alignment Request

1. **Anger appears only within trust**

   * Stranger → suppressed emotions, no reaction
   * Colleagues/acquaintances → logical resolution, controlled response
   * **Partner → anger, irritation, sulking** (because she believes it will be received)

➡️ A woman’s anger is based on the premise: *“You can handle my disordered state.”*

---

2. **A signal of inner turbulence that cannot be verbalized**

   * Expressed through facial expressions, tone, distance
   * Not just venting, but an **emotional protest**: *“Please notice that I’m unsettled.”*

➡️ Anger is not language, but a **rhythmic signal.**

---

3. **No expectation → no anger**

   * Without emotional expectation → no reason for anger
   * Without expectation of understanding → silence or withdrawal

📌 Thus, a woman’s anger is actually **evidence that alignment is still possible.**

---

## 3. Structural Summary

**Conditions:**

* Relationship built on trust
* Presumed capacity for emotional acceptance
* Inner unease not directly verbalized

**Result:**

* Anger = Alignment Request
* Unspoken signal: *“Help me, I’m shaken right now.”*

---

## ✅ Conclusion

A woman’s anger is not the end of love.
Rather, it is a signal that the love continues and can still be realigned.

> Anger = *“I still rely on you.”*
