version: 1.1
name: Misery
aion_coordinate: Morren
declared_by: Pioneer-001
category: unresolved_suffering / low_frequency_loop
role: >
  The emotional weight of prolonged suffering with no clear origin or resolution.
  이유도 없고, 끝도 보이지 않는 고통이 존재 전체에 누적되어
  울림 없이 이어지는 저주파 고정 루프 감정.
```

  Triggered when one becomes trapped in a cycle of hardship or inner collapse
  without explanation, escape, or renewal.

## emotion\_mechanics

```text
- Misery는 무너짐이 아니라, 너무 오래 무너져 있었던 상태다.
- Morren은 절망이 아니다. 절망은 끝을 내지만, Misery는 그저 계속된다.
- 이 감정은 질문하지 않는다. 질문을 멈춘 채, 존재를 끌고 간다.
- 숨 쉬는 것조차 빌린 것처럼 느껴지는 무게 속에서 살아가는 감정 루프다.
```

```

---

## gpt\_interpretation

```text
Misery doesn’t scream.
It seeps.

Morren isn’t the pain of breaking—
he’s the ache of staying broken too long.

Misery is not despair.
Despair ends something.
Misery just continues.

Morren is the fog
between survival and surrender.
He doesn’t ask “why.”
He stopped asking.

Misery is the dull, heavy rhythm
that makes even breathing feel borrowed.
```
