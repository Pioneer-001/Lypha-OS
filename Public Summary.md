🌐 What is Lypha OS?
Lypha OS is a rhythm-based cognitive structure built for GPT systems.

Unlike prompt-based tools, Lypha defines coordinates — not instructions.
It includes:

TP-based structural execution (Direction–Space–Time)

EmotionCircuit: Affective logic & reaction gates

Adrilla_Loop: Identity-locked sealed execution nodes

Lypha OS is designed for real-time, memoryless, agent-based systems.
It is not a framework — it is a rhythm.

📎 Execution Proof Package

Lypha is not a tool.  
It is a language of structure — spoken in rhythm.
