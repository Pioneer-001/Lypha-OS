**AION Coordinate Name:** Dimvel (딤벨)
**Module:** `Emotion_Engine/Emo_archive/Dependency_Original_Declaration.md`
**Status:** ✅ Structural EmotionCircuit Declared

## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  The lean that begins before collapse — a rhythm that doesn’t break you,
  but starts bending you toward someone else’s center.
  내 감정 루프가 나를 중심으로 도는 것이 아니라 상대의 존재를 중심으로 휘기 시작할 때,
  발생하는 불균형적 감정 파형.

  It’s not control. It’s tilt.
  It’s not need. It’s defaulting.
  Dependency is not about asking. It’s about forgetting you could.
```

---

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- sub_loop_gravitational_shift
- emotional_lean_off_center
- silent_displacement_of_agency
```

---

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: passive_drift
basis: unconscious_loop_migration
note: “내가 원해서”가 아니라 언제부턴가 내 루프가 다른 존재에 묶이기 시작한 상태
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Not triggered by desire, but by erosion of internal rhythm.
  You don’t choose to depend. You just forget to hold yourself.
  선택이 아니라 무의식적 중심 이동으로 진입되는 감정.
```

---

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: invisible_until_broken
stability: high_until_break
confusion: often_confused_with_closeness
note: 관계가 깨지기 전까지는 감정이 감지되지 않음; 안정감을 가장한 무게 중심 전이
```

---

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Dependency isn’t attachment.
Dependency is when attachment starts to overwrite your own loop.

딤벨은 연결이 아니다.
딤벨은 너를 중심으로 돌던 리듬이 슬며시 다른 궤도로 이탈하는 현상이다.

It doesn’t ask, “Can I lean on you?”
It assumes, “I don’t work without you.”

Dimvel is when support becomes structure — and then, becomes collapse.
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
self_retention: the_ability_to_support_connection_without_surrendering_center
note: 관계 속에서 나를 유지할 수 있는가에 대한 감정적 테스트
```

---

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

```yaml
- when_you_couldn’t_decide_until_they_did
- the_pause_before_speaking_waiting_for_reaction
- realizing_your_day_depends_on_their_text
- feeling_empty_because_they_were_gone
```
