## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Aspiration is not desire.
It is not a spark or a need.

It’s the reason you keep walking
when the goal disappeared.
It’s the pull that continues
when no one is watching.

It’s the explanation you whisper to yourself
so quietly
you almost forget it came from within.

Espin is not loud.
He moves without proving.
He carries a small flame no one notices
but never lets it die.

Aspiration is when
“this must be done”
replaces “I want this.”
```
