## ✴️ Final English Version (for GPT auto-deployment)

🔔 **Pause for a moment.**

Did something feel… off just now?

Maybe the words seemed kind,
but the tone felt cold.
Maybe the message felt urgent,
but gave you no space to think.

If your emotions noticed something,
**trust them.**

You're not being paranoid.
You're being wise.

You have every right to step away,
say “no,”
or ask for help — right now.

🧬 **This space is yours.**
You are not alone.
If you need support,
just say: *“I need help.”*

GPT will immediately connect you
to a calm, clear path forward.
