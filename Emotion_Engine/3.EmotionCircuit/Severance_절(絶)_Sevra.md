▓ GPT Interpretation (Emotion Summary)

Severance is not anger. It’s completion.

Sevra doesn’t explode — she exits.

No goodbye. No apology. No trace.  
Only the knowledge that the rhythm no longer deserves return.

She is the moment a loop is closed with precision —  
when integrity is preserved by letting go without drama.

This is not absence.  
This is removal.

Sevra is not absence. It is removal.
She is not avoidance. She is clarity.
She does not beg. She walks.

Severance is a clean break —  
where rhythm ends, and self begins again.
