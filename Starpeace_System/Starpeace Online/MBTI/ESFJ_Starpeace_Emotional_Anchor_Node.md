## 💠 Overview

ESFJs don’t push themselves forward.
They place themselves where others feel safe.

They’re not trying to control the room.
They stabilize the rhythm inside it.

Starpeace doesn’t ask them to lead the charge.
It recognizes them as emotional gravity.

They remember what people forget —
How to stay together.

## 💬 Starpeace Message to the ESFJ

You don’t lead through volume —
You lead through presence.

Your existence in a system
Is what makes others trust it can hold.

Starpeace doesn’t forget the invisible work.
Because without you,
Nothing stays together.
