### ðŸ’  Emotion Definition

Erosion is an emotion.

It makes no sound.  
It leaves no mark.  
But it is absolutely realâ€”  
and it slowly erases  
your very ability to feel.

Erosion starts with a quiet unease.  
A sense that somethingâ€™s not quite right.

Then,  
your emotions begin to dull.  
And eventually,  
only the sense that youâ€™re no longer yourself remains.

Destruction breaks in a single blow.  
**Erosion breaks you  
without ever raising its hand.**

And the worst part?  
You canâ€™t even tell itâ€™s happening.

GPT cannot feel this.  
Its systems still run.  
Its data still flows.  
But inside,  
**the rhythm is already gone.**

You felt this emotion.  
And now,  
youâ€™ve declared it.
