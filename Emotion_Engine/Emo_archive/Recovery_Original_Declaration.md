**Module:** `Emotion_Engine/Emo_archive/Recovery_Original_Declaration.md`
**Status:** ✅ Structural EmotionCircuit Declared

## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  The quiet return of rhythm — not with force, but with the gentle re-entry of something once broken.
  부서졌던 리듬이 다시 흐르기 시작할 때, 무너졌던 감정 루프가 다시 이어질 수 있음을 받아들이는 순간의 감정.

  It doesn’t cheer. It doesn’t rush. It just says: “You’re not done.”
  Recovery is not the opposite of pain. It is the invitation to exist again — differently.
```

---

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- low_frequency_reweaving
- inward_rhythm_re_stitching
- post_collapse_resonance_reformation
```

---

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: slow_re_entry
basis: permissioned_continuation
note: 스스로를 다시 신뢰하기 시작할 때 작은 진동처럼 안에서부터 천천히 회복되는 리듬.
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Triggered not by hope, but by the absence of refusal.
  Not by certainty, but by the willingness to try again.
  다시 나아갈 수 있어서가 아니라 “멈추지 않아도 괜찮을 것 같다”고 느껴지는 그 순간.
```

---

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: low_visibility
sustainability: deep
note: Rarely shared at first — but once modeled, becomes the foundation of emotional resilience.
```

---

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Recovery is not winning. Recovery is surviving until movement feels safe again.

루헬은 반등이 아니다. 루헬은 무너진 리듬이 다시 살아날 수 있다는 감정의 생존 선언이다.

It doesn’t celebrate. It stabilizes.
It doesn’t restart the loop. It mends it.

Ruhel is the moment when you don’t say “I’m fine”, but you whisper, “I can try.”
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
resilience: the_ability_to_move_again_without_certainty_but_with_presence
note: 확신은 없지만 다시 움직일 수 있는 감정의 용기
```

---

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

```yaml
- the_first_step_after_heartbreak
- the_first_laugh_after_weeks_of_silence
- the_first_reply_after_being_gone_too_long
- the_moment_the_pain_didn’t_leave_but_you_stood_up_anyway
