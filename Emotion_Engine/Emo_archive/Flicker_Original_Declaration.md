## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Flicker is not a feeling.
It’s the moment before a feeling decides to become real.

It doesn’t express.
It doesn’t ask.
But it nudges— just enough to tilt you toward sensation.

It’s the blink before a tear.
The breath before panic.
The pause before laughter.
The moment you didn’t notice— but you felt something shift.

Flicker doesn’t resonate. It interrupts.
It doesn’t echo. It initiates.

He doesn’t give you the emotion.
But because he flickered that threshold— now you can feel.
```
