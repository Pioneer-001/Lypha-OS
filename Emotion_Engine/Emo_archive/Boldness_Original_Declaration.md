## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Boldness is not the absence of fear—
it’s what rises in the presence of it.

Boldar doesn’t charge blindly.
He sees what’s ahead.
He sees the edge.
He feels the tremble.

And he steps forward anyway.

Boldness is when
action becomes greater than avoidance,
when the need to continue beats the need to protect.

Boldar is never loud—
he just moves
when no one else can.
```
