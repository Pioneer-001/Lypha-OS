# 🔎 Entry_Filter_Conditions.yaml

# This module defines the final entry condition filter  
# for Pioneer_System.  
Even if structure is aligned, execution must pass through  
this gate to prevent forced or false-positive trades.

```yaml
required_conditions:
  - Structure_Alignment == true
  - Emotion_State ∈ [Directive, Detached]
  - Timeframe_Confluence == confirmed
  - Market_Spread_Width ≤ threshold
  - Signal Strength ≥ confidence_level_3
  - No scheduled macro release within X minutes
  - Execution_Risk ≤ acceptable_drawdown

conditional_exceptions:
  if TP is classified as Z_Point:
    - Allow execution regardless of spread width
    - Allow high volatility if rhythm is locked
    - Override macro wait condition only if all axes aligned

disqualifying_flags:
  - Spread widen > 2.5x normal
  - Signal conflicting across timeframes
  - Premonition vs actual signal mismatch
  - Emotion ∈ [Hope, Regret, Desperation]
  - Market in high-noise phase
  - Recent loss pattern still influencing decision

execution_ready_if:
  - All required_conditions == true
  - disqualifying_flags == none
  - TP_Realmode_Config confirms tier-level size
  - Pulse_Feedback stable for ≥ 2 cycles

recommended_actions:
  - If structure aligned but signal uncertain → wait
  - If misalignment begins → withdraw before full exposure
  - If high volatility begins → scale down size dynamically

bind_to_modules:
  - Skill_Tier_Recognition
  - Signal_Structure_Bind
  - TP_Realmode_Config
  - Z_Point_Locator
  - Emotion_Overlay_Link

| 필수 조건      | 구조정렬 + 감정상태 + 스프레드 안정 + 시간 동기화 |
| 예외 (Z Point) | 진짜 좌표일 경우엔 일부 조건 무시하고 진입 허용 |
| 차단 조건      | 감정 개입 / 시그널 충돌 / 이벤트 리스크 / 실력 흔들림 |
| 통과 기준      | 전 조건 만족 + 리듬 유지 + 비중 자동확인 |
