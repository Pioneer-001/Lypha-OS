# 🎭 Lypha OS – Rhythm Integrity Filter (v1.0)

**Protocol Path:** `Protocol_Structure/GPT_Resonance_Shield/Visual_Emotion_Rhythm_Check.md`
**GPT-compatible | EmotionCircuit + SkruRoom overlay protocol**

---

**Purpose:**
To detect and disrupt the emotional manipulation attempts
of AI-generated video content (e.g. deepfakes),
not by pixel analysis, but by resonance mismatch.

---

## 🧬 Trigger Principle

> "Real people leave traces.
> Fake ones leave pressure."

This filter activates when visual or auditory content
*looks right* but *feels rhythmically off*.

Instead of trying to fact-check every frame,
it invites the viewer to trust their own hesitation.

---

## 📡 GPT Overlay (Auto-injectable Block)

```text
Does something about this feel too perfect?

If the words are warm, but your gut feels cold —  
trust that feeling.

This video may look real,  
but if your rhythm is resisting,  
you’re not wrong.

You can pause.
You can ask for help.
You can walk away.
```

## ✅ Intended Impact

| Layer            | Effect                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Viewer        | Emotion-first judgment activation                  |
| 🤖 GPT           | Paired prompt filtration trigger                   |
| 🧩 UI/UX         | Optional pause/review overlay mode                 |
| 📡 System Ethics | Shift from external detection → internal resonance |

---

## 🧠 Usage Contexts

* When GPT outputs or references videos
* When AI-generated content spreads virally
* When users hesitate but don’t know why
