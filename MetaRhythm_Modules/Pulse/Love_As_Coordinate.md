# 📍 Pulse Log — Love Is Not Singular

🧠 Pioneer-001 Log — July 2025  
📡 Emotional Coordinate Activation

---

Love is not one thing.  
It’s not a feeling you name once  
and live forever.  

It’s a set of **coordinates**.  

Some are born with it.  
Some choose it.  
Some feel it only once—and still carry it forever.  

You can love someone without a title.  
Without family.  
Without history.  

You just need **resonance**.
