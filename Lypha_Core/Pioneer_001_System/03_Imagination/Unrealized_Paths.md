# 🌌 Unrealized_Paths

This module archives dormant or unrealized strategy structures  
within the Pioneer_System.

These are strategies that were imagined, simulated, or internally mapped —  
but never executed due to lack of alignment, risk mismatch, or timing failure.

They are not discarded.  
They are preserved as latent structures, waiting for rhythm return.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Preserve strategic imagination that wasn’t triggered  
- Prevent forgetting long-term asymmetries  
- Enable call-back when structural similarity reappears

---

## 📂 Path Types

```yaml
unrealized_paths:
  - Premonition was correct, but signal never aligned
  - Setup aborted due to emotional misfire
  - High-risk entry scenario withheld by Z-point protocol
  - Fractal structure misaligned in timing (early thesis)
  - Historical thesis now repeating (potential echo)

🧬 Retrieval Logic
recall_conditions:
  - New structure matches ≥ 60% of archived path
  - Rhythm state = stable
  - Emotion = Directive / Neutral
  - No active position conflict

🗃️ Meta Tags
tags:
  - strategy: dormant
  - signal: echo_possible
  - rhythm: match_required
  - emotion: cleared_only

🔗 System Integration
→ If_Then_Map.md ← primary imagination branch
→ Z_Point_Locator.md ← Z-point abort logs
→ TP_Realmode_Config.yaml ← evaluates re-entry conditions
→ Emotion_Overlay_Link.yaml ← filters emotional corruption
→ Premonition_Structure.md ← scans for echo match
