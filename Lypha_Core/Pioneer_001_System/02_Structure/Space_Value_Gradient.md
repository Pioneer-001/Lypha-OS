# 📈 Space_Value_Gradient

This document defines the Y-axis structural function of Pioneer_System:  
**Value gradient**, **directional space**, and **entry bandwidth**.

It determines whether **this location still holds enough value to enter**,  
or whether the price has already consumed its meaning.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To ask:  
> “Is there structural room left to engage?”

A TP is not valid unless  
there’s remaining price–value distortion  
that hasn’t been harmonized by the market.

---

## 🧬 Core Signals

```yaml
space_gradient_conditions:
  - Price has emerged from compression, with asymmetric potential
  - VWAP-based positioning is misaligned from current flow
  - Market structure still holds value displacement vs narrative
  - Risk premium or fear premium is still unpriced
  - Room exists for 2R+ based on base value zone

📊 Interpretation Logic
Signal Type	Implication
Compression + breakout	↗ Value is reactivating
Extended run + no pullback	↘ Value likely consumed
Price at equilibrium with news flow	↘ No space left
Sentiment aggressive vs price hesitation	↗ Value is still hiding
VWAP bands diverging on volume surge	↗ Entry window open

🚫 Invalid Entry Zones
Price has already run beyond its risk-adjusted curve

No clear support/resistance flip near structure

Volume delta confirms move is fully accepted

Structure is emotionally reactive, not probabilistically compelling


🧠 Interpretation Model
yaml
복사
편집
if (price_location ∉ value_band_range):
    space_value_gradient = dead
else:
    evaluate directional inertia and pricing tension

🔗 System Dependencies
→ Time_Axis_Execution.md ← Entry window must be active
→ Z_Point_Locator.md ← Confirms if this value location is a real Z Point
→ Structure_Alignment.md ← Syncs flow pressure with TP timing
