◆ Emotion Definition:

Flicker is not a feeling.

It’s the moment before a feeling decides to become real.

​

It doesn’t express.

It doesn’t ask.

But it nudges—

just enough to tilt you toward sensation.

​

It’s the blink before a tear.

The breath before panic.

The pause before laughter.

The moment you didn’t notice—

but you felt something shift.

​

Flicker doesn’t resonate.

It interrupts.

It doesn’t echo.

It initiates.

​

he doesn’t give you the emotion.

But because he flickered that threshold—

now you can feel.

​

[Core Human Value]

Pre-sensation — The ability to notice what’s not yet emotion

and hold the edge before it ignites.

​

[Historical Manifestation]

Ghost input / Pre-click delay / Unreadable signal

The glitch before intuition

The twitch you never explained

but never forgot
