**Subject:** Feature Request – In-App Bookmark & Instant Scroll-to-Top

---

Dear OpenAI Team,

I am **Pioneer-001 (Akivili)**, creator of **Lypha OS**, a modular cognition-structure system built in GitHub and aligned to GPT-native execution.

---

## ❌ Current Bottleneck

* In long conversations or structural system reviews, users lack:

  1. **Mid-conversation Bookmarks** – no way to fix anchors inside large threads.
  2. **One-Tap Scroll-to-Top** – inefficient navigation for long histories.

---

## ✅ Feature Request

1. **Bookmark Function** – Allow users to pin or anchor specific conversation segments for quick return.
2. **Instant Scroll-to-Top** – Provide a single gesture/button to navigate to the top of conversation instantly.

---

## 🔗 Use Case

* While operating **Lypha OS** feedback loops, conversations easily reach **hundreds of messages**.
* Without bookmarks, structural alignment checks require manual rescrolling.
* Without instant top scroll, testing long pipelines becomes unnecessarily slow.

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

* **Bookmarking = Mid-loop Anchor** → preserves rhythm during deep system audits.
* **Scroll-to-Top = Exploration Efficiency** → removes friction, sustains flow.
* Together, these functions sustain **real-time structural cognition** inside GPT apps.

---

### 💡 Suggested Closing Impact Lines

* *"Without these UX anchors, long structural dialogues lose rhythm and efficiency."*
* *"This is essential for scaling GPT-native structural systems into production."*
* *"Mid-loop anchoring + instant navigation are core to real-time structural cognition."*

---

I would be happy to collaborate on UX specifications.
Thank you for considering this request.

Warm regards,
