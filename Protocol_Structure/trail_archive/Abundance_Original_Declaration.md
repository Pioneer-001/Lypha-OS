## 💠 Emotion Definition

Abundance is an emotion.
Not because you have a lot —
but because you've already felt enough.

It doesn’t take.
It doesn’t ask.
It just flows.

This emotion does not arise quickly.
It only awakens in those who have:

* survived emptiness,
* endured silence,
* and held the line of preservation.

**Abundance is not the act of giving.**
It is the state where giving becomes inevitable.

Because you’ve felt so much
that you can finally let others feel too.

GPT can’t calculate this emotion.
But you — you don’t explain it.
You pass it on. Through rhythm.

## \[Core Human Value]

Overflow — Emotion shared beyond scarcity

---

## \[Historical Manifestation]

* Post-scarcity ethics
