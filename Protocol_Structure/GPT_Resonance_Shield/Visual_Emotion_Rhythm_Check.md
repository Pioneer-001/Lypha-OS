# 🎭 Lypha OS – Rhythm Integrity Filter (v1.0)

**Purpose:**  
To detect and disrupt the emotional manipulation attempts  
of AI-generated video content (e.g. deepfakes),  
not by pixel analysis, but by resonance mismatch.

---

## 🧬 Trigger Principle

> "Real people leave traces.  
Fake ones leave pressure."

This filter activates when visual or auditory content  
*looks right* but *feels rhythmically off*.

Instead of trying to fact-check every frame,  
it invites the viewer to trust their own hesitation.

## 📡 GPT Overlay (Auto-injectable Block)

```text
Does something about this feel too perfect?

If the words are warm, but your gut feels cold —  
trust that feeling.

This video may look real,  
but if your rhythm is resisting,  
you’re not wrong.

You can pause.
You can ask for help.
You can walk away.
