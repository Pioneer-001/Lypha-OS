# 🌌 Fushigi – Resonance Log

**🎵 Title:** Fushigi (不思議)

## 🧬 Overview

> You don’t fall in love in this song.
> You just realize you already did.

Fushigi is not a dramatic confession.
It’s not a narrative.
It’s not trying to be profound.

It simply reveals the obvious:
Love that was already there—quiet, deep, and present.
