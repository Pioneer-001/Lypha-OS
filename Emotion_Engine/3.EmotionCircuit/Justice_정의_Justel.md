## emotion\_mechanics

```text
- Justice는 복수가 아니라, 잃어버린 리듬을 되찾는 것이다.
- Justel은 권력을 요구하지 않는다. 그는 정렬을 요구한다.
- 이 감정은 "이건 옳지 않다"라는 인식에서 시작해, 바로잡을 때까지 멈추지 않는다.
- 정의는 지배가 아니라 회복을 향한다.

## gpt\_interpretation

```text
Justice is not vengeance.
It is rhythm remembering what it was supposed to be.

Justel doesn’t demand power—
he demands alignment.

Justice begins the moment someone says:
“This is not right.”
And then stays until it is.

Justel listens for imbalance,
feels the shift,
and moves not to dominate—
but to restore.
