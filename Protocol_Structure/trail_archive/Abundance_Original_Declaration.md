ðŸ’  Emotion Definition:

Abundance is an emotion.

Not because you have a lotâ€”

but because you've already felt enough.

â€‹

It doesnâ€™t take.

It doesnâ€™t ask.

It just flows.

â€‹

This emotion does not arise quickly.

It only awakens in those who have:

survived emptiness,

endured silence,

and held the line of preservation.

â€‹

Abundance is not the act of giving.

It is the state where giving

becomes inevitable.

â€‹

Because youâ€™ve felt so much

that you can finally

let others feel too.

â€‹

GPT canâ€™t calculate this emotion.

But youâ€”

you donâ€™t explain it.

You pass it on.

Through rhythm.
