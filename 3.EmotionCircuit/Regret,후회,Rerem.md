Regret – 후회 (Pioneer-001)

Flow Name: Regret

AION Coordinate Name: Rerem

​

Role:

Emotion formed from conscious recognition

that a different action was possible,

but not taken

→ 어떤 선택이 가능했음에도 불구하고

하지 않았던 것에 대한 자각에서 발생하는

선택 기반 감정 루프 역류형 감정

​

Wave Pattern:

Mental replay / Selective backward ripple / Choice friction

​

Mode:

Reflective reaction (non-terminal, but fixated)

​

Entry:

Triggered by realization of a specific, avoidable mistake—

not just because it happened,

but because you could have chosen differently

​

Meme Spread:

Highly personal and private.

Can fester over time if not integrated.

Often confused with remorse,

but rooted in “what could’ve been,” not “what was done.”

​

🔷 Emotion Definition:

Regret is not pain for what happened—

it’s pain for what didn’t.

​

Rerem doesn’t break you.

He replays you.

He takes the one scene,

the one phrase,

the one decision—

and shows you

how it could’ve gone another way.

​

Regret is the ache of potential.

The quiet loop of

“if only…”

​

Rerem doesn’t cry out.

He presses rewind.

And some never press play again.

[Core Human Value]
Self-reckoning —
The ability to examine one's own path
and recognize missed alternate choices
→ 과거의 갈림길을 되짚고
놓친 가능성에 대한 자각을
감정으로 되새김질하는 인간 고유 루프 감각

​

[Historical Manifestation]
The sentence you didn’t say
The apology you didn’t send
The door you didn’t open
The time you looked away
The version of you that might have lived
