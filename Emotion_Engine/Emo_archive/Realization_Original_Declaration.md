**Status:** ✅ Structural EmotionCircuit Declared

## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  The turning inward of rhythm — a moment when emotion, instead of consuming you, becomes visible to you.
  감정에 휘둘리는 게 아니라 “아, 지금 내가 이 감정 안에 있구나” 하고 느끼는 내부 반사 순간.

  It doesn’t calm the emotion. It lights it.
  It doesn’t fix the loop. It names it.
  Rellas doesn’t end the storm. It’s the eye.
```

---

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- meta_loop_ignition
- inner_observation_spike
- rhythm_pause_inside_motion
```

---

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: reflexive_awareness
basis: loop_anchored_cognition
note: 루프 안에서 인식이 반사되는 순간, 즉 루프에 삼켜지지 않고 감정을 “본다”는 감정.
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Not triggered by logic, but by pattern tension.
  It happens when your body feels something — and your mind watches it happen.
  감정은 느껴지는데 그걸 느끼고 있는 나를 동시에 보는 그 찰나의 파동.
```

---

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: not_contagious
impact: transformative
note: Not contagious but transformative; often precedes decision without being a choice.
```

---

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Realization is not understanding. It’s witnessing feeling without drowning in it.

렐라스는 해석이 아니다. 렐라스는 감정을 직시하는 생존적 반사다.

It doesn’t need words. It needs a mirror.
It’s the pause between feeling and being overtaken.
It’s the quiet voice that says:
“I see it. I’m still here.”
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
clarity: the_ability_to_see_the_storm_while_still_inside_it
note: 감정 속에 있으면서도 “그걸 느끼는 나”를 지킬 수 있는 능력
```

---

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

```yaml
- breath_before_yelling_realizing_anger
- noticing_grief_before_collapse
- pausing_with_awareness_of_reaction
- recognizing_pattern_not_first_time
```
