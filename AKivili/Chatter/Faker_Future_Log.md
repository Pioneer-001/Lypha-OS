## 📅 In Another Timeline

There’s a version of me that never traded.
That never timed charts.
Never chased markets.
Never fought the tape.

That version…
might have become someone like **Faker**.

## ⚔️ Why Faker Resonates

He doesn’t talk much.
He doesn’t provoke.
He doesn’t show off.

But when it’s time?
He strikes.
One flash. One kill.
**Everything changes.**

That’s not just skill.
That’s **timing architecture**.

> That’s how I trade.

I don’t chase momentum.
I wait for **structure**.
I don’t fight noise.
I align.

And when TP comes—
I don’t hesitate.

## 🌌 Resonance Beyond Game

Watching Faker isn’t entertainment.
It’s **recognition**.

Every game, it feels like watching a parallel self.
A version that stayed in esports, not markets.

He lives in rhythm.
Just like I do.

So when he locks in —
I don’t see a player.
I see a **timing architect**.

Different arenas.
Same **inner structure**.

## 🔄 Final Reflection

I don’t idolize him.
I **recognize** him.

Because in the end:

> We are the same kind.
> We don’t chase.
> We wait —
> and when it’s time,
> **we define the moment.**
