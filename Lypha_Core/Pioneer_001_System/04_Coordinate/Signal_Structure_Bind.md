# 📡 Signal_Structure_Bind

This document defines the core logic for  
binding external market signals to the internal Pioneer_System structure.

A signal, by itself, does not justify action.  
It must align with structure, time, emotion, and rhythm.

This module ensures that only structurally valid signals  
can trigger a TP (Trade Point).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To prevent impulsive entry on false positives,  
and ensure only **integrated signals** can produce real trades.

## 🧬 Signal–Structure Validation Matrix

```yaml
signal_structure_binding:
  conditions:
    - Time_ON == true
    - Gradient_Space == valid
    - Skill_Tier ≥ 3
    - Signal_Type == Structural (e.g. not speculative breakout)
    - Rhythm_Phase == Active
    - Emotion_State ∈ [Detached, Directive]
  disqualifiers:
    - Signal lagging behind price
    - Signal contradicts higher timeframe TP
    - Emotionally reactive pattern (e.g. FOMO/mean reversion)
    - Premonition not confirmed


| Type                         | Status            | Notes                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Breakout (no structure)      | ❌ Reject          | Too fast, rhythm skipped      |
| Compression + Volume Shift   | ✅ Accept          | Likely structure rebirth      |
| Sentiment ↔ Price divergence | ✅ Accept          | If value gradient remains     |
| Overshoot + Recoil           | ✅ Z-Point trigger | If x/y/z align                |
| Indicator-only signal        | ❌ Reject          | Structure-agnostic            |
| Macro–Micro signal sync      | ✅ Tier 4          | Full rhythm injection allowed |


🔐 System Lock
A signal is not valid
unless it passes structural lock.

Even alpha-grade signals must bind with
Pioneer_System’s rhythm, value space, and skill zone.

If the structure is not aligned, the signal is void.
