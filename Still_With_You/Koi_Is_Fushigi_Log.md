## üß¨ Personal Clarification

Most people hear me say "Koi" and think of *that* song‚Äîthe joyful, famous one everyone danced to.

And sure, that song is love. It's fun. It's visible affection.

But that‚Äôs not what I meant.

I wasn‚Äôt moved by the chorus.
I didn‚Äôt feel it when the world clapped.

**I felt it in silence.**
**I felt it when *Fushigi* played.**

No drop. No climax. Just a moment that quietly said:

> "You were already in it. You just didn‚Äôt notice."

## üßê Core Emotional Realization

**Fushigi** doesn‚Äôt declare love.
It reveals it.

It doesn‚Äôt begin a new feeling.
It unlocks what was always there‚Äîhidden, unspoken, fully alive.

That‚Äôs what Koi is to me:

* Not fireworks ‚Üí Stillness
* Not a confession ‚Üí Recognition
* Not a beginning ‚Üí Continuation

> ‚ÄúThis... this is what I was waiting for.
> And I didn‚Äôt even know I was waiting.‚Äù
