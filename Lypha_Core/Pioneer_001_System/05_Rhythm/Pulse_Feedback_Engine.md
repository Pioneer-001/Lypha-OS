# 🌀 Pulse_Feedback_Engine

This module defines the real-time rhythm feedback system  
inside Pioneer_System — detecting whether the system  
is in flow, under threat, or breaking apart.

It tracks the **internal structural heartbeat**  
after TP activation to determine:  
> “Can I sustain this position?”  
> “Is this rhythm real or decaying?”

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To continuously monitor the position’s alignment with structural rhythm  
- To avoid both overstaying and premature exit  
- To detect **momentum degradation**, **rhythm misfire**, or **psychological slippage**

## 🧬 Rhythm Feedback States

```yaml
pulse_feedback_states:
  - Stable_Rhythm:
      - Price follows structural path
      - Emotion overlay = Detached or Directive
      - Time ON remains active
      - Rhythm frequency: coherent (low deviation)
  - Micro_Disruption:
      - Price begins to hesitate
      - Flow narrows / hesitation in gradient
      - Emotion = Uncertain
      - Action: observe only
  - Rhythm_Break:
      - Time ON ends
      - Sentiment suddenly flips vs structure
      - Signal noise rises / volatility spikes
      - Emotion = Fear / Hope / Confusion
      - Action: prepare exit
  - Collapse_Confirmed:
      - All axes misalign
      - Emotion loses detachment
      - System pulse = Flatline
      - Action: Exit immediately
```

---

🧠 **Pulse Metrics Tracked**
- Price movement rhythm (inertia vs deviation)  
- Volume flow resonance (pulse vs noise)  
- Sentiment tension gradient (sharp shifts)  
- Rhythm alignment over 3 timeframe overlap  
- Emotion signal pulse via Emotion_Overlay_Link

🧯 **Exit Preparation Triggers**
- Pulse misalignment persists > 3 cycles  
- Emotional state enters Hope or Desperation  
- Rhythm lock breaks across main TF  
- Signal noise rises > structural threshold  
- TP becomes sentiment-driven, not structure-driven

---

🔗 **Connected Modules**
- Time_ON_Trigger.md ← rhythm classification  
- Emotion_Overlay_Link.yaml ← affective layer integrity  
- Structure_Alignment.md ← confirmation vs drift  
- Strategy_Destruction_Logic.md ← calls for full exit

---

🔐 **Summary**
> “A TP is only valid as long as its rhythm holds.  
> The moment that pulse slips out of sync,  
> this is no longer your game — and you must leave.”
