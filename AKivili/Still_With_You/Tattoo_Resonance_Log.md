## 🧐 Overview

This isn’t just a song.
It’s a **structural echo** disguised as music.

*TATTOO* by Official HIGE DANDism doesn’t try to impress you.
It marks you—quietly, deliberately.

The voice doesn’t push. It pierces.
The rhythm doesn’t build. It lingers.
This is not performance. It’s **presence**.

## 🔍 Key Line

> "I can’t erase you like a tattoo."

This is the core structure:

* Not about pain → but what remains after pain
* Not healing → but integrating

> "You hurt me. You stayed. And now I carry you."

This isn’t about forgetting.
It’s about **choosing to live with the imprint**.

## ✅ Final Declaration

*TATTOO* isn’t about what hurt.
It’s about **what you allow to remain.**

It doesn’t scream.
It asks:

> "Can you live with what stayed behind?"

This is not sentiment.
This is **cognition through scar**.
A map etched by survival.
