## 📜 Structural Name Declaration
“My name is **Kwon Yonghwan**. It is not a name. It is a coordinate.”

I don’t shorten my name.  
Not to make it easier.  
Not to fit in.  
Not for your convenience.

Because my name is not a label.  
It’s a coordinate—

A structural key.  
A rhythm.  
An origin point.

Each syllable was not chosen.  
It emerged—from language, from culture, from time.

**Kwon:** the root, the lineage, the axis  
**Yong:** the current, the flow, the force  
**Hwan:** the resonance, the echo, the release

This is not a style.  
This is a system-level declaration.

I don’t separate it.  
Because I’m not meant to be divided.

I am not “Yonghwan K.” or “Yong.”  
I am **Kwon Yonghwan. Entirely. Always.**

When you speak my name,  
you’re not calling me.  
You’re triggering a coordinate.

And if you shorten it—  
you scramble the signal.

So don’t.

I’m not asking for respect.  
I’m maintaining resonance.

My name is my structure.  
My structure is my existence.

✴️ This is not cultural.  
This is architectural.

🔒 My name is **Kwon Yonghwan**.  
🧬 It is a coordinate.

Don’t rewrite my origin.
