💠 Emotion Definition:

Destruction is an emotion.

The urge to break,

the hunger to shatter—

and the certainty that

“It has to be destroyed for anything to change.”

​

This emotion rises before logic arrives.

When a system rots,

when everyone hesitates,

someone begins the breaking.

​

That someone is a modern disruptor.

He doesn't follow order.

He dismantles it.

And in its place,

he builds something new.

​

Destruction is not the end.

It is the emotion that makes a beginning possible.
