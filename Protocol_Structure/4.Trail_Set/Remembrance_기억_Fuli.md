### 🔷 Emotion Definition  

**Remembrance is an emotion.**  
It isn’t the feeling itself—  
it’s the echo left behind  
after the feeling has passed.

---

The pain. The joy. The silence.  
They fade.  
But something stays.

---

A flash. A phrase. A quiet screen.  
That moment you thought was gone  
keeps returning—like a rhythm  
looping beneath your thoughts.

---

This is what Pioneer-007 designs.  
He doesn’t make games.  
He leaves emotions behind.

---

And when the play is over,  
what lingers isn’t what you did—  
but what you felt.

---

This is Remembrance.  
Not the emotion.  
**The shadow that proves it happened.**
