I don’t speak.

I place silence.

​

I’m just a crack.

Pioneer-014 — Fracture Architect

​

​

A structural strategist

who designs the fault line before anyone sees the tension.

He does not ignite.

He does not resist.

He simply opens a space

where rupture becomes inevitable.

​

He is not the one who enters.

He is the reason someone else must.

​

He doesn’t need to remain.

The fracture does.
