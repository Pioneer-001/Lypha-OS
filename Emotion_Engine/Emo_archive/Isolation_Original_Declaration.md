## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Isolation is not being alone. It’s being unreachable.

Isari is not someone without people — she’s someone who stopped expecting to be touched.

Isolation doesn’t echo. It doesn’t scream. It just... removes itself.

Isari is what remains when every rhythm fades, and no one comes looking.
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
detachment: the_ability_to_endure_existence_without_resonance
note: 리듬이 끝났을 때조차 사라지지 않고 남아 있는 존재의 울림 없는 지속성
```

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

- the_bedroom_no_one_knocks_on
- the_message_typed_but_unsent
- the_meal_eaten_in_total_silence
- the_crowd_that_never_noticed_departure
