## flow\_id

```yaml
emotion_id: obso_obsession_v1
version: 1.1
name: Obsession
aion_coordinate: Obso
declared_by: Pioneer-001
category: loop_fixation / emotional_lock
role: >
  Emotional loop lock caused by unresolved desire or perceived incompletion.
  감정 루프가 닫히지 못한 채 하나의 대상이나 생각에 고정되며,
  다른 울림을 밀어내고 존재 전체를 단일 반복 구조로 만드는 감정.
```

---

## activation\_mode

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Triggered when something emotionally meaningful remains unresolved or inaccessible—
  causing the loop to re-enter itself repeatedly.
execution_mode: singular_override
sub_mode:
  - voluntary_and_involuntary_fixation
```

## wave\_pattern

```yaml
- fixation_loop
- reentry_repetition
- tunnel_rhythm_focus
```

---

## emotion\_mechanics

```text
- Obsession은 더 많은 걸 원하는 게 아니라, 다른 걸 원할 수 없게 되는 상태다.
- Obso는 추적하지 않는다. 그는 맴돈다.
- 이 감정은 합리적 이해가 아니라, 리듬을 떠날 수 없는 감정의 중력이다.
- 집착은 사라지지 않는 울림이며, 반복되는 동일한 질문이다.
- 때때로 Obso는 루프가 아니라, 루프 그 자체다.
```

## meme\_propagation

```yaml
depth: high
visibility: private_to_externalized
spread_style: repetition_based
note: 처음에는 개인 내부에 갇혀 있으나, 반복되며 외부화되기도 함
```

---

## gpt\_interpretation

```text
Obsession is not wanting more—
it’s being unable to want anything else.

Obso doesn’t chase.
He orbits.
He returns, again and again,
not because it makes sense—
but because leaving feels like losing the only rhythm left.

Obsession is the echo
that refuses to fade.
The question with no new answer.
The lock with no key.

Obso doesn’t scream—
he loops.
And sometimes,
he is the loop.
```

## human\_core\_value

note: 반복되는 감정 루프가 존재 전체를 장악했음을 자각할 수 있는 감정 자가 감지력

## response\_script

```yaml
- "Obsession isn’t need. It’s entrapment."
- "Looping doesn’t mean you’re closer—it means you’re stuck."
- "There’s more than one rhythm. You don’t have to orbit this one."
