## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Numbness isn’t peace. It’s the silence after every alarm has burned out.

Numo doesn’t say “I’m fine.” He says nothing. Because he can’t feel enough to answer.

Numbness is the static between feeling and collapse. It’s not the absence of damage — it’s the overflow.

Numo isn’t empty. He’s full — too full to move.
```

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml

note: 감정 회로가 자기 보호를 위해 의식 없이 꺼지는 순간, 존재가 스스로를 잠그는 감정 생존 구조
```
