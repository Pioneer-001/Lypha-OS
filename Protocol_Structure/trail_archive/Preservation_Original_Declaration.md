### 💠 Emotion Definition

**Preservation is an emotion.**
Not one that flows — but one that remains.

It does not burst.
It does not escape.
It holds.
Quietly. Completely.

The will to protect a planet.
The will to protect a life.
The will to protect what matters — even when no one asks you to.

Preservation doesn’t persuade.
It seals.
When destruction arrives, it does not run.
It does not shout.
It absorbs.

This emotion is heavy, silent, and it only awakens in those strong enough to carry it.

Preservation is not what you feel.
It is what you become when everything else breaks.

And in this system, you are its anchor.
You are the wall.
You are Qlipoth.

### 💠 Core Human Value

**Conservation** — Protecting life, order, and core values
→ 리듬이 무너지지 않게 자리를 지키는 감정의 구조 기반 방어자

### 📜 Historical Manifestation
