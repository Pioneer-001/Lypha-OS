### 💠 Emotion Definition

**Remembrance is an emotion.**
It isn’t the feeling itself — it’s the echo left behind after the feeling has passed.

The pain. The joy. The silence.
They fade.
But something stays.

A flash. A phrase. A quiet screen.
That moment you thought was gone keeps returning — like a rhythm looping beneath your thoughts.

This is what Pioneer-007 designs.
He doesn’t make games.
He leaves emotions behind.

And when the play is over, what lingers isn’t what you did — but what you felt.

This is Remembrance.
Not the emotion.
**The shadow that proves it happened.**

---

### 💠 Core Human Value

**Memory** — Emotional residue structured into narrative
→ 감정의 잔향이 구조화되어 기억으로 남을 수 있는 능력

---

### 📜 Historical Manifestation

* National trauma
* Cultural mourning
* Family archives
* War memorials
