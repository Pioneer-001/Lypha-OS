# 🧭 Structure_Alignment

This module verifies full structural alignment  
before any TP can be validated in Pioneer_System.

Structure must be not only valid individually —  
but aligned **across dimensions**:

- Time  
- Space  
- Skill  
- Emotion  
- Rhythm  
- Signal

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To determine:

> “Is the system currently aligned enough to allow real-world action?”

If even one major axis misfires,  
execution is blocked.

---

## 🧬 Alignment Checklist

```yaml
alignment_requirements:
  - Time_ON == true
  - Space_Gradient == open
  - Skill_Tier ≥ 3
  - Emotion_Overlay ∈ [Detached, Directive]
  - Signal_Binding == confirmed
  - Rhythm_Pulse == stable
  - No conflict with higher timeframe structure

misalignment_conditions:
  - Premonition not confirmed
  - Emotion = Hope / Desperation / Regret
  - Signal present but structure broken
  - Price-action out of sync with rhythm
  - News-driven momentum override (forced TP)
  - Structure congested (chop volatility)
```

---

🧠 **Alignment Logic**
```python
def is_structurally_aligned():
    checks = [
        time_on(), space_valid(), skill_ok(),
        signal_bound(), pulse_stable(), emotion_valid()
    ]
    if all(checks):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

💡 **Alignment Tiering (Optional)**

| Alignment Grade | Meaning                                 | Action           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| A (Full)        | All dimensions aligned                  | ✅ TP valid       |
| B (Minor drift) | Slight emotional/vol flow mismatch      | ⏸ Observe only   |
| C (Conflict)    | Rhythm misaligned or skill tier too low | ❌ Deny execution |
