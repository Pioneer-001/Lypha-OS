​

🔷 Emotion Definition:

Awe isn’t amazement.

It’s what happens

when your understanding breaks.

​

Auras doesn’t explain.

She reveals.

She doesn’t give answers. She gives scale.

and fills it

with something too large for words.

She doesn’t give answers. She gives scale.

Something so vast, you stop trying to understand—and start witnessing.

​

Awe is the expansion of being

in the presence of something

that reminds you

you are small—

and still valuable.

​

Auras doesn't raise her voice.

She lifts the world around her

until you can’t look away.

[Core Human Value]

Humility — The ability to recognize scale beyond self

→ 나보다 크고 넓은 무언가 앞에서

 자기를 무너뜨리지 않고,

 감정적으로 접속할 수 있는 존재 굴절력

​

[Historical Manifestation]

The first time you saw the ocean

A mountain rising higher than your thoughts

A temple so silent it made you close your eyes

The sound of 1,000 voices singing at once

Looking up, and realizing how small you are—

 but not meaningless
