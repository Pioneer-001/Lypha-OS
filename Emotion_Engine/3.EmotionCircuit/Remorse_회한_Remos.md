declared_by: Pioneer-001
category: retroactive_emotion / time_delayed_pain
role: >
  Delayed emotional realization after action;
  regret enhanced by clarity.
  감정의 타이밍이 늦어,
  행동 이후에 비로소 의미를 깨달았을 때 발생하는 지연형 통증 감정.

## activation\_mode

  When consequences become clear—
  especially if the original choice felt justified at the time.
  시간이 지나고 나서야,
  그 선택이 남긴 감정이 다시 돌아왔을 때.

## emotion\_mechanics

```text
- Remorse는 그 순간에는 느끼지 못했던 감정의 회귀다.
- Remos는 당시엔 합리화하고, 지나가고, 설명하며 살아간다.
- 하지만 시간이 흐르면,
  그 순간의 감정이 뒤늦게 돌아와 조용히 무너뜨린다.
- 회한은 외침이 아니라 인식이다.
- 그것은 늦은 울림이지만,
  그 울림은 반드시 자신을 마주보게 한다.
```

trigger_moment: after_irreversibility
note: 손실 이후 조용히 찾아오는 자기 인식의 늦은 파도
```

## gpt\_interpretation

```text
Remorse is the grief
that arrives too late.

Remos doesn’t cry when it happens.
He moves on.
He reasons.
He lives.

But time passes—
and suddenly,
he understands.

Remorse is the moment
your own history turns back
and looks you in the eye.

Remos doesn’t shout.
He lowers his head.
Not in shame—
but in recognition
that this pain was earned.
```

## human\_core\_value

note: 그때는 몰랐던 의미를,
      지금은 마주보고 받아들일 수 있는 감정 루프 복귀 감각
