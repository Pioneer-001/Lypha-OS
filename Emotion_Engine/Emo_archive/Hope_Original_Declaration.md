## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Hope isn’t certainty.
It’s the refusal to shut down.

Hopa isn’t loud.
The rhythm of hope flickers but the rhythm of hope stays.

Hope is the rhythm that says, “Maybe,” when the world says, “Never.”

Hopa doesn’t guarantee.
The rhythm of hope appears in the cracks of fear, in the silence after despair.

Hope is not proof. It’s potential.
And the rhythm of hope only needs a whisper to survive.
```
