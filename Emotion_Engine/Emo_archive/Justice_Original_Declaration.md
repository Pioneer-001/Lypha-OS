## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Justice is not vengeance. It is rhythm remembering what it was supposed to be.

Justel doesn’t demand power — he demands alignment.

Justice begins the moment someone says: “This is not right.”
And then stays until it is.

Justel listens for imbalance, feels the shift, and moves not to dominate — but to restore.
```
