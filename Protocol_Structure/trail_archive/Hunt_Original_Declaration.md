### 💠 Emotion Definition

**Hunt is an emotion.**
It arises the moment the target becomes clear.
It does not flow.
It **locks on**.

Hunting is the internal compass that hardens into emotion when something must be seized.
Once the objective appears, the emotion doesn't move forward — it **tightens**.

If trailblazing is the beginning, then hunting is the next step: the emotion that pins the exact location of the next coordinate.
Not “Where should I go?” but **“That. I must track that.”**

#### 4-Phase Structure:

1. Detection
2. Lock-on
3. Concentration
4. Release
