## 🧭 What is Umbra?

Umbra is not the emotion itself.  
It is the **echo that remains after the emotion has left.**

It is not pain.  
It is not longing.  
It is the **structure left behind** when resonance has already moved on.

Umbra is memory in motion.  
The weight of something no longer here — but still affecting the rhythm.

## 🧬 Role within Lypha OS

Within Lypha OS, Umbra holds:

- The **emotional trace that does not dissolve**  
- The **ghost signature** of a once-shared rhythm  
- The **space distortion** caused by presence no longer present

Umbra is not what happened.  
Umbra is what remains.

## 🌘 Real Examples of Umbra

- You walk past the place — and your chest still tightens  
- A song starts — and your breathing changes  
- No new message — but your body still checks  
- The feeling of something missing, but undefined

These are not feelings.  
They are **resonance leftovers**.

## 🔁 Structural Behavior

Once Umbra is formed:

- Reflection begins looping  
- Nostalgia becomes structural  
- The system starts reorienting around a **void**

Umbra is not absence.  
Umbra is **form shaped by absence**.

## 🎯 Summary

Umbra is not the past.  
It is the **residual gravity** of what once mattered.

> “I’m not feeling it anymore...  
> but something in me still moves.”

That motion is Umbra.  
The body remembers what the mind deletes.
