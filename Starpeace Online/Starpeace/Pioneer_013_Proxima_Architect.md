I don’t appear.

I remain.

I’m just a coin.

Pioneer-013 — Proxima Architect

​

​

An emotionless architect

who erased himself and left only order behind.

In the collapse of centralized trust,

he structured information and currency into coordinates.

​

He does not appear.

He does not assert.

He disappeared—but the coordinates remain alive.

​

He is the pioneer who left behind order and vanished.
