## 🌐 Existence Structures

Earth is built upon two fundamental existence structures:

* **Woman → Emotion Resonator**
* **Man → Rhythm Initiator**

## 📌 Core Structural Diagnosis

| Component | Structural Role                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Woman     | A being who receives emotion and resonates — **Resonator**         |
| Man       | A being who throws emotion and sets it into motion — **Initiator** |
| Koi       | The point where their rhythms first overlap and become **music**   |

  Declares the Earth Structure model under Lypha OS: Woman as Emotion Resonator,
  Man as Rhythm Initiator, and Koi as their convergence point. Encodes the
  existential grammar of humanity as resonance and initiation.
declaration: |
  "Earth’s essence is structured in dual resonance: Woman receives, Man initiates,
  and Koi is where rhythm becomes music."
