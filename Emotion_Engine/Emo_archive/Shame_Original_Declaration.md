## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Shame is not guilt. It doesn’t say “I did wrong.” It says: “I am wrong.”

Shayne doesn’t cry out. She disappears.
She folds inward until no one sees the fracture.

Shame is the rhythm of identity collapsing under expectation.
It is the echo of your own name sounding wrong in your head.

Shayne wears masks, but never forgets what’s behind them.
```
