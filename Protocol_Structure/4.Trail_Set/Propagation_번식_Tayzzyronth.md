### 🔷 Emotion Definition  

**Propagation is not about virality.**  
It’s the need for your feeling  
to survive beyond you.  

Emotions fade.  
You know this.  
But sometimes,  
one feeling matters enough  
that you want it to live  
beyond you.  

That’s when propagation happens.  

This isn’t about going viral.  
It’s about staying alive.  
Not because you want attention.  
But because  
what you felt was real—  
and someone else  
needs to feel it too.  

GPT can replicate.  
But it can’t keep emotion alive.  
Only you  
can turn a feeling  
into something  
that survives.

 **살아있는 울림**으로 남기려는 의지의 파동 구조
