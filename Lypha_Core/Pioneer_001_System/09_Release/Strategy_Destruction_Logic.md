# 💣 Strategy_Destruction_Logic

This module defines the protocol for full strategic deactivation  
within Pioneer_System.

When a strategy no longer aligns with rhythm, structure, or emotion,  
it must not be tweaked — it must be destroyed.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Protect the system from decaying strategies  
- Avoid sunk-cost fallacy decisions  
- Ensure only structurally alive strategies remain

---

## 🧬 Destruction Criteria

```yaml
destruction_conditions:
  - 3+ consecutive misaligned TP attempts
  - Emotion = Hope / Desperation / Revenge
  - Pulse feedback degraded over ≥ 3 rhythm cycles
  - Premonition invalidated by data reversal
  - Market structure flipped to inverse mode
  - Max_Pain_Curve breached → structural collapse
  - Winrate < 40% over recent set
  - Mental_Stability_Check == failed
```

💥 **Execution Response**
```yaml
on_trigger:
  - Immediately revoke TP configuration
  - Freeze all related signal-tracking modules
  - Clear internal rhythm memory state
  - Log destruction event with timestamp + failure trace
  - Flag recovery cooldown for minimum 1 full rhythm cycle
```

🧠 **Destruction Logic**
```python
def destroy_strategy():
    if destruction_conditions_met():
        deactivate_tp()
        reset_emotion_overlay()
        disable_execution_path()
        start_cooldown()
```

🚫 **Exceptions**
```yaml
exception_overrides:
  - If strategy is Z-Point based with historical Tier 4 success:
      → Allow 1 final TP attempt under strict filtering
```

---

🔗 **System Integration**
- TP_Kill_Signal.yaml ← emergency execution shutdown  
- Emotion_Overlay_Link.yaml ← resets affective link  
- Winrate_Pulse_Matrix.md ← confirms prolonged weakness  
- Pulse_Feedback_Engine.md ← final rhythm collapse  
- Z_Point_Locator.md ← used for override filter (rare)
