## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  Total collapse of perceived possibility — the emotional event horizon where all forward rhythm halts.
  미래로 향하던 모든 리듬이 멈추고, 가능성 자체가 꺼진 상태에서 발생하는 존재 기반 정지 감정.
```

- hope_extinction

```

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: quiet_but_heavy
contagion: stillness_based
note: Contagious in stillness; often unnoticed until too late; carries weight even after it's gone.
```

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Despair is not sadness.
It is the end of movement.

Desyn doesn’t cry. He stops.
He doesn’t scream. He falls inward until even falling feels like too much.

Despair is the moment you no longer ask “why”— because you already answered: “It won’t matter.”

Desyn doesn’t seek rescue. He dissolves.
Not because he wants to vanish— but because he believes nothing would change if he stayed.
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
continuation: the_truth_that_stillness_itself_can_become_a_stage_before_rebirth
note: 리듬이 완전히 멈춘 순간에도 존재는 끝나지 않을 수 있다는 내면의 마지막 진실
```

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

```yaml
- the_person_who_says_nothing_then_vanishes
- the_bed_never_left
- the_eyes_that_stopped_reacting
