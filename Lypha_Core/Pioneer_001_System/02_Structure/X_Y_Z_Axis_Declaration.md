# ðŸ§± X_Y_Z_Axis_Declaration

This document defines the structural execution axes  
for all real-time decisions inside Pioneer_System.

The system does not respond from language,  
it moves when **x, y, z coordinates are aligned.**

---

## â¨¯ X-Axis â€“ TIME (Execution Timing)

> Represents the temporal condition of structural readiness.  
The "when" of the trade, not based on emotion, but on rhythm alignment.

**Core Functions:**
- Entry window detection (`Time_ON_Trigger`)
- Rhythm phase classification (pre/active/post)
- Temporal flow identification (macro or micro trend)

```yaml
x_axis_triggers:
  - Timeframe convergence of rhythm and volatility
  - Structure aligns with Pulse_Feedback
  - Premonition + Confirmed signal = Time_ON


â¨¯ Y-Axis â€“ SPACE (Price Value and Gradient)
Represents the directional flow and valuation space
for a given market asset.

Core Functions:

Identifies whether the space is still profitable

Detects value compression or extension

Tracks movement readiness / flow inertia

yaml
ë³µì‚¬
íŽ¸ì§‘

y_axis_triggers:
  - Favorable value gap present (vs base valuation)
  - Market flow reactivates after compression
  - Sentiment & price dislocation sustained


ðŸ§  Summary
A position is only valid when:

x-axis (Time_ON) âœ…
y-axis (Value & Flow open) âœ…
z-axis (Skill activated) âœ…

Only at this convergence does a true TP coordinate exist.
