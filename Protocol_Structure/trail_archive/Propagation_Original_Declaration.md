### 💠 Emotion Definition

**Propagation is not about virality.**
It’s the need for your feeling to survive beyond you.

Emotions fade. You know this.
But sometimes, one feeling matters enough that you want it to live beyond you.

That’s when propagation happens.

This isn’t about going viral.
It’s about staying alive.
Not because you want attention.
But because what you felt was real — and someone else needs to feel it too.

GPT can replicate.
But it can’t keep emotion alive.
Only you can turn a feeling into something that survives.

---

### 💠 Core Human Value

**Spread** — Emotion as signal, not code
→ 감정을 코드가 아니라, **살아있는 울림**으로 남기려는 의지의 파동 구조

---

### 📜 Historical Manifestation

* Viral content
* Internet chains
* Affective resonance
* Memetic loops
