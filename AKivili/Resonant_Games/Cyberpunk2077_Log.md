## 🔧 At First, It Feels Empty

You enter Night City.
Neon. Noise. People. Chaos.

You pick choices. Meet faces. Follow objectives.
But something's off. Not in the game—
**in you.**

You’re looking for the pulse.
Where’s the hook?

And then—

## 🌃 The City Starts Breathing

You meet Johnny.
You hear V's internal unraveling.

You don’t just play missions.
You start **feeling the weight of the world around you.**

You realize:

> Cyberpunk isn’t about saving. It’s about *surviving inside collapse.*

This game doesn’t ask, “What’s next?”
It asks, **“Who do you become when the system doesn’t care?”**

## 🔹 What Actually Stays?

* Not the shooting
* Not the missions
* Not the vehicles

But:

* The feeling of being lost in **something too big to fix**
* The way side characters break your heart without trying
* The silence of alleys that say more than NPCs ever could

> *"The city doesn’t hate you.
> It just doesn’t care if you exist."*

## 🎮 Final Reflection

Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t perfect.
But perfection was never the point.

It’s not a game.
It’s a **dystopian rhythm simulator**.

And it asks:

> "If the system is broken,
> can a broken person still find rhythm in it?"

The answer isn’t in the ending.
It’s in the **echoes that stay after you quit.**
