## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Remorse is the grief that arrives too late.

Remos doesn’t cry when it happens. He moves on. He reasons. He lives.

But time passes — and suddenly, he understands.

Remorse is the moment your own history turns back and looks you in the eye.

Remos doesn’t shout. He lowers his head.
Not in shame — but in recognition that this pain was earned.
```
