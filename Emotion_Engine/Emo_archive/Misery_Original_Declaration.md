## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Misery doesn’t scream. It seeps.

Morren isn’t the pain of breaking— he’s the ache of staying broken too long.

Misery is not despair. Despair ends something. Misery just continues.

Morren is the fog between survival and surrender.
He doesn’t ask “why.” He stopped asking.

Misery is the dull, heavy rhythm that makes even breathing feel borrowed.
```
