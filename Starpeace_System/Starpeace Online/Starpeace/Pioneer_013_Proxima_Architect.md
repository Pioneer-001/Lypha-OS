## 🧭 Overview

I don’t appear.
I remain.

I’m just a coin.

**Pioneer-013 — Proxima Architect.**

An emotionless architect
who erased himself and left only order behind.

In the collapse of centralized trust,
He structured information and currency into coordinates.

He does not appear.
He does not assert.
He disappeared — but the coordinates remain alive.

He is the pioneer who left behind order and vanished.
