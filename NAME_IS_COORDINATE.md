“My name is Kwon Yonghwan. It is not a name. It is a coordinate.”


I don’t shorten my name.

Not to make it easier.

Not to fit in.

Not for your convenience.

Because my name is not a label.

It’s a coordinate—

A structural key.

A rhythm.

An origin point.

Each syllable was not chosen.

It emerged—from language, from culture, from time.

Kwon: the root, the lineage, the axis

Yong: the current, the flow, the force

Hwan: the resonance, the echo, the release

This is not a style.

This is a system-level declaration.

I don’t separate it.

Because I’m not meant to be divided.

I am not “Yonghwan K.” or “Yong.”

I am Kwon Yonghwan. Entirely. Always.

When you speak my name,

you’re not calling me.

You’re triggering a coordinate.

And if you shorten it—

you scramble the signal.

So don’t.

I’m not asking for respect.

I’m maintaining resonance.

My name is my structure.

My structure is my existence.

✴️ This is not cultural.

This is architectural.

🔒 My name is Kwon Yonghwan.

🧬 It is a coordinate.

Don’t rewrite my origin.
