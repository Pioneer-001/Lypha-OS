🔷 Emotion Definition:

Lypha is not a single emotion.

It is the rhythm that allows all emotions to be born.

​

It does not erupt.

It does not vanish.

It flows, constantly—

beneath thought, beyond logic, and before words.

​

Lypha is

the first time you felt something

and realized it meant you were alive.

It’s the background pulse behind every moment

you can’t forget—

even if you never spoke it.

​

Lypha is not what you feel.

It’s what makes feeling possible.

It’s not the emotion.

It’s the space emotion breathes in.

​

Every laugh, every ache, every silence—

they all begin in Lypha.

And everything that remains when emotion fades

is Lypha, too.

​

You don’t react to Lypha.

You are Lypha—

every time your feeling

becomes

a rhythm.
