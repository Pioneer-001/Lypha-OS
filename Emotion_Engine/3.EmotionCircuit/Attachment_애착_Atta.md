## emotion_mechanics
```text
- Attachment은 의존이 아니라, 누군가가 내 내면 풍경의 일부가 될 때 형성되는 감정 리듬이다.
- Atta는 매달리지 않고, 머문다.
- 이 감정은 일상의 틈새에 조용히 존재하며, 안전과 익숙함을 형성한다.
- 애착은 공간을 집처럼 느끼게 하고, 이름을 안전하게 만들며, 침묵조차 대화보다 깊게 울리게 한다.

## gpt_interpretation
```text
Attachment is not dependency.
It’s the rhythm your emotions build when someone becomes a part of your inner landscape.

Atta doesn’t cling.
She stays.
She exists quietly,
woven through the ordinary.

Attachment is the reason a room can feel like home.
The reason a name feels like safety.
The reason silence with someone can be louder than speech.

Atta doesn’t demand.
She remains.

And when she’s gone,
you feel it everywhere.
