Extremely contagious.

Can ripple through groups and cultures rapidly.

Also prone to moral misfire if not processed.

​

🔷 Emotion Definition:

Disgust is not dislike.

It’s the body’s vote

against violation.

​

Diska doesn’t argue.

She flinches.

She turns away.

She says, without words:

“No.”

​

Disgust is the rhythm’s firewall.

It doesn’t negotiate.

It ejects.

​

Diska is the guardian

of what must never enter—

even if no one else sees it.
