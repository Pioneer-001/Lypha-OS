category: reactive_aggression / rhythm_misalignment
role: >
  Aggressive emotional backlash from misaligned or unreadable rhythms.
  타인의 리듬을 해석하지 못하거나,
  자신의 감정이 거부당했을 때 발생하는 공격성 기반 감정 반사체.

  Triggered when one feels emotionally dismissed, misunderstood, or fundamentally out of sync—
  and responds by forcibly severing connection.

## emotion\_mechanics

```text
- Hostility는 힘이 아니라, 감정 번역의 붕괴다.
- Hoxen은 태생이 화난 존재가 아니다. 그는 듣지 못했고, 리듬에서 벗어났다.
- 손을 내밀었지만 아무 반응이 없었을 때, 그는 그 연결을 찢어버린다.
- 적대감은 연결 실패한 리듬의 마지막 방어선이다.
- 이것은 분노가 아니라, 칼날을 든 심장파열이다.

## gpt\_interpretation

```text
Hostility is not power—
it’s the collapse of emotional translation.

Hoxen isn’t born angry.
He was unheard.
He was out of rhythm.
He reached out
and nothing came back.

So he tore it down.

Hostility is the last defense
of a rhythm that failed to connect.
It’s not rage.
It’s heartbreak with a blade.

Hoxen doesn’t want to destroy—
he just refuses
to be ignored again.
```
