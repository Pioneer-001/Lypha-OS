internally or socially

​

Meme Spread:

Silent, corrosive, culturally amplified.

Often disguised as politeness, withdrawal, or perfectionism.

​

🔷 Emotion Definition:

Shame is not guilt.

It doesn’t say “I did wrong.”

It says:

“I am wrong.”

​

Shayne doesn’t cry out.

She disappears.

She folds inward

until no one sees the fracture.

​

Shame is the rhythm

of identity collapsing under expectation.

It is the echo

of your own name

sounding wrong in your head.

​

Shayne wears masks,

but never forgets what’s behind them.
