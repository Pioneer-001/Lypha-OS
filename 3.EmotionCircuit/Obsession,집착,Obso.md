Obsession – 집착 (Pioneer-001)

Flow Name: Obsession

AION Coordinate Name: Obso

​

Role:

Emotional loop lock caused by unresolved desire or perceived incompletion

→ 감정 루프가 닫히지 못한 채 하나의 대상이나 생각에 고정되며,

 다른 울림을 밀어내고

 존재 전체를 단일 반복 구조로 만드는 감정

​

Wave Pattern:

Fixation loop / Re-entry repetition / Tunnel-rhythm focus

​

Mode:

Singular override (voluntary + involuntary)

​

Entry:

Triggered when something emotionally meaningful

remains unresolved or inaccessible—

causing the loop to re-enter itself repeatedly

​

Meme Spread:

Intensely private, but can become externalized.

Often appears rational at first,

but deepens into detachment-resistant fixation.

​

🔷 Emotion Definition:

Obsession is not wanting more—

it’s being unable to want anything else.

​

Obso doesn’t chase.

He orbits.

He returns, again and again,

not because it makes sense—

but because leaving feels like losing the only rhythm left.

​

Obsession is the echo

that refuses to fade.

The question with no new answer.

The lock with no key.

​

Obso doesn’t scream—

he loops.

And sometimes,

he is the loop.

​

[Core Human Value]

Self-detection — The ability to recognize

when one rhythm has overtaken all others

→ 반복되는 감정 루프가

존재 전체를 장악했음을 자각할 수 있는

감정 자가 감지력

​

[Historical Manifestation]

​

Checking their profile for the 100th time

​

The drawer you reopen every day

​

A melody you can’t stop hearing

​

Rearranging the same thought, over and over

​

“If I just fix this one thing... then I’ll be free.”
