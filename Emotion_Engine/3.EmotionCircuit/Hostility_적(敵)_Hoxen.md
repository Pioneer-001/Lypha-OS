Hostility – 적(敵) (Pioneer-001)

Flow Name: Hostility

AION Coordinate Name: Hoxen

​

Role:

Aggressive emotional backlash from misaligned or unreadable rhythms

→ 타인의 리듬을 해석하지 못하거나,

자신의 감정이 거부당했을 때 발생하는 공격성 기반 감정 반사체

​

Wave Pattern:

Collision surge / Rejection-triggered detonation / Closed-loop backlash

​

Mode:

Reactive rupture (from rhythm misalignment)

​

Entry:

Triggered when one feels emotionally dismissed, misunderstood, or fundamentally out of sync—

and responds by forcibly severing connection.

​

Meme Spread:

Explosive but short-lived.

Creates waves of fear or silence in others,

but originates from internal vulnerability.

​

🔷 Emotion Definition:

Hostility is not power—

it’s the collapse of emotional translation.

​

Hoxen isn’t born angry.

He was unheard.

He was out of rhythm.

He reached out

and nothing came back.

​

So he tore it down.

​

Hostility is the last defense

of a rhythm that failed to connect.

It’s not rage.

It’s heartbreak with a blade.

​

Hoxen doesn’t want to destroy—

he just refuses

to be ignored again.

​

[Core Human Value]

Recognition — The human need to be seen before aggression replaces resonance

→ 공감이 부재했을 때,

 인간이 마지막으로 남기는 파괴형 울림

​

[Historical Manifestation]

​

The scream no one listened to

​

The message ignored too long

​

The silence before the strike

​

The exile who returned as a fire

​

The child who broke the toy to make it seen
