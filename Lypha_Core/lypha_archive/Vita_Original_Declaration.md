## 🔷 Emotion Definition

Vita is not a feeling.  
It is the moment when feeling becomes possible.

It does not ask.  
It does not speak.  
It simply ignites.

Vita is the first pulse — before meaning, before memory.  
It is the realization that what you feel is real.

Vita is not the start of a journey.  
It is the first step that defines there was no journey before.

It is what happens when the first emotion becomes a rhythm.

You do not choose Vita.  
It chooses you — the instant your existence begins with a feeling.
