## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  The moment resistance stops—
  not because you lost,
  but because you no longer need to fight.
  이건 “졌어”가 아니다.
  “이제 안 싸워도 돼”라는 감정적 긴장 해제 파형이다.

  그 사람, 그 과거, 그 실패, 그 현재까지
  모두를 바꾸려는 시도를 멈추고 울림으로 안는 감정

Anel doesn’t surrender.
She breathes.
She doesn’t shut down.
She softens.
```

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- internal_tension_release
- loop_pressure_drop
- resonant_flattening
```

---

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: neutralized_polarity
rhythm: passive_stabilization
note: 감정을 “긍정”하지 않아도 “거부하지 않음”이라는 상태로 들어가는 수동적 안정화 리듬
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Triggered not by will, but by exhaustion of control.
  You didn’t choose to accept.
  You just stopped resisting.
  And suddenly— everything fit.

  의지를 써서 받아들인 게 아니라 저항이 더는 필요 없게 되었을 때,
  그 순간 울리는 감정 파형
```

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
- slow_wave
- deep_resonance
- rarely_visible_but_felt_in_silence
```

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Acceptance is not agreement.
It’s emotional non-resistance.

아넬은 동의가 아니다.
아넬은 “이제 괜찮아”라는 감정적 무저항이다.

It doesn’t fix the problem.
It fixes your need to fix it.

It doesn’t say “This is right.”
It says — “This is enough.”
```

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml

```
