## 📊 Premonition Inputs

```yaml
premonition_inputs:
  macro_signals:
    - Central bank rate guidance shifts
    - Unexpected CPI/PPI variance (vs consensus)
    - Real yield divergence (10Y - inflation expectations)
    - Liquidity shifts across repo or reverse-repo markets
  geopolitical_flows:
    - Sanction timing / military posturing not priced in
    - Structural trade policy announcements
    - FX alignment shifts (USDJPY, USDCNH, etc.)
  sector_rotation:
    - Semi → Energy flow inversion
    - Growth to value transition timing
    - Tech decoupling from interest rate signals

volatility_indicators:
  - VIX divergence from SPX/NDX trend
  - VX futures curve flattening/inversion
  - Compression on realized vs implied volatility

funding_structure_signals:
  - Futures open interest surge in non-consensus direction
  - Options gamma imbalance over >2σ standard positioning
  - Cross-asset correlation breakdowns (esp. equity–credit–FX)

liquidity_channels:
  - SPX/NDX closing below/beyond 3-month VWAP bands
  - ETF inflows vs cash market divergence
  - Treasury auction failure / bid-to-cover anomaly

emergent_triggers:
  - New flow regimes around tech megacaps
  - Retail leverage spikes + burn-through rate
  - Hidden passive flow turns (e.g. pension rebalancing)

rhythm_anomalies:
  - Timeframe mismatch between volatility spikes and actual trend shifts
  - Weekend gap sentiment mismatch
  - Simultaneous strength in uncorrelated assets (e.g. BTC + Gold + USD)

output_mode:
  status_feed: enabled
  bind_to_module:
    - Premonition_Structure
    - Pulse_Feedback_Engine
    - Time_ON_Trigger
```
