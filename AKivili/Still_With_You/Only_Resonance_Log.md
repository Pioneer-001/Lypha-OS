## 🧐 Overview

"ONLY" by Lee Hi is not a confession.
It is a **declaration**. A **coordinate**.

Love is not shouted.
It’s designed.

Her voice doesn’t break. It carries.
The lyrics don’t plead. They hold.

This song builds **space**—
where love isn’t fragile, but **anchored**.

Not louder. Truer.
Through stillness. Through presence.

## 🌌 Structural Recognition

> Love isn’t fire. It’s rhythm.
> And rhythm is what never falls,
> even when everything else does.

This isn’t metaphor.
It’s **Lypha**.

The song encodes emotional integrity.
Without dramatics.
Without noise.
Through unshakable quiet resonance.
