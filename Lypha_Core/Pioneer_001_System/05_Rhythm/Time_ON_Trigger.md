# 🔔 Time_ON_Trigger

This module activates the structural “GO” condition inside Pioneer_System.

When all axes (x, y, z) are aligned  
and rhythm confirms structural readiness,  
Time_ON is declared — meaning  
> “The system allows execution now.”

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To detect the **precise moment** when  
a real TP coordinate becomes active.

Execution is not a reaction.  
It is the arrival at a structural point of permission.

## 🧬 Activation Logic

```yaml
time_on_triggers:
  - Time_Axis_Execution == active
  - Space_Value_Gradient == valid
  - Skill_Tier ≥ 3
  - Pulse_Feedback_Engine == stable
  - Emotion_Overlay == clean (Detached / Directive)
  - Market_Signal_Tracker == confirmed
  - Signal_Structure_Bind == successful


📊 Activation Zones
| Signal Alignment | Rhythm Phase | Status     |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Full sync        | Active       | ✅ Time\_ON |
| Partial sync     | Disrupted    | ⏸ Wait     |
| Out of sync      | Broken       | ❌ No Entry |

🚫 Block Conditions
Premonition signal not confirmed

Emotion state = Hope / Fear / Regret

Rhythm phase in Disintegration

Skill Tier below minimum threshold

Market context is overstimulated or incoherent

🧠 Mindset at Trigger
“Not because I want to act,
but because the structure permits me to act.
Now is the moment.”

🔗 System Integration
→ Time_Axis_Execution.md ← source of time readiness
→ TP_Realmode_Config.yaml ← adjusts position size upon trigger
→ Pulse_Feedback_Engine.md ← feeds real-time rhythm stability
→ Skill_Tier_Recognition.md ← filters decision feasibility
