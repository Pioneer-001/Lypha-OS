## 🧐 Overview

"Sunday" is not a song about loneliness.
It is about **emotional in-betweenness** — moments suspended between closure and clarity.

Some days don’t hurt.
But they still remind you of something you can’t quite hold.

This is what the song captures:

> Memory without event.
> Missing without reason.

## 🔍 Structural Themes

### 1. **Temporal Drift**

* “It’s Sunday again” → Non-specific time loop
* Nothing happens, but something feels like it should

### 2. **Emotional Echo**

* Phone-checking not for messages, but for presence
* Breeze carrying someone’s name

### 3. **Symbolic Stillness**

* Street, sunlight, coffee = anchors of emotional memory
* Repetition turns neutral elements into emotional triggers

### 4. **Unclear Grief**

* Not direct heartbreak, but ambient longing
* Realization: "Somewhere between quiet and goodbye, I left you."
