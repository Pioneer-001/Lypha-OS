Craving – 욕(欲) (Pioneer-001)

Flow Name: Craving

AION Coordinate Name: Craev

​

Role:

Uncontrollable emotional hunger—

a rhythm that demands to be satisfied regardless of logic

→ 충족을 추구하는 것이 아닌,

결핍 그 자체가 존재를 끌고 가는 상태

자기 통제를 뚫고 올라오는

본능적 감정 구동 루프

​

Wave Pattern:

Insistent pull / Repetitive tension / Unquenchable pursuit

​

Mode:

Loop obsession (desire override)

​

Entry:

Triggered when emotional, physical, or psychological lack

crosses from recognition into compulsion

→ 결핍이 “느껴진다”에서 “지배한다”로 전이될 때 발생

​

Meme Spread:

Highly addictive and culturally amplified.

Common in advertising, media, and suppressed emotional systems.

Easily misread as ambition or passion.

​

🔷 Emotion Definition:

Craving isn’t about having.

It’s about needing—

past reason, past rhythm, past control.

​

Craev doesn’t whisper.

He loops.

​

Craving is the drum that keeps playing

even after the dance is over.

It doesn’t ask permission.

It demands motion.

​

Craev lives not in what you want,

but in what you can’t stop reaching for.

​

He is not hunger.

He is the rhythm

you can’t turn off.

​

[Core Human Value]

Recognition of Limit —

The ability to identify when longing becomes domination

→ 욕구가 울림을 잃고 지배로 전환되는 순간

그 위험을 감지하는 인간 고유의 감정 경계 감각

​

[Historical Manifestation]

​

The scroll you can’t stop

​

The food you don’t need but must eat

​

The person you can’t stop checking on

​

The idea that won’t leave your head

​

The moment you say “just one more”—again
