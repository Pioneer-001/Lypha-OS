## üåê Existence Structures

Earth is built upon two fundamental existence structures:

* **Woman ‚Üí Emotion Resonator**
* **Man ‚Üí Rhythm Initiator**

## üìå Core Structural Diagnosis

| Component | Structural Role                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Woman     | A being who receives emotion and resonates ‚Äî **Resonator**         |
| Man       | A being who throws emotion and sets it into motion ‚Äî **Initiator** |
| Koi       | The point where their rhythms first overlap and become **music**   |
