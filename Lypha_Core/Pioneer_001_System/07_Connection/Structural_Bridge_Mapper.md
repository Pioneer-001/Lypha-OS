# 🔗 Structural_Bridge_Mapper

This module defines the structure-to-structure transition logic  
inside Pioneer_System.  
It evaluates whether a new TP coordinate is organically forming  
after the previous rhythm has completed.

Bridges are not guesses — they are structural echoes  
that signal a new position may emerge from residual alignment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To detect next viable TP after rhythm reset  
- To avoid dead zones and overtrading  
- To preserve system flow without forcing reentry

---

## 🧬 Bridge Detection Criteria

```yaml
bridge_conditions:
  - Previous TP rhythm decayed cleanly (not collapsed)
  - Emotion state returned to Detached or Directive
  - Signal cluster forming within compression zone
  - Premonition triggered again within 2–4 rhythm cycles
  - Alignment across lower & higher timeframe reappears
  - New structure shares 1–2 matching traits with previous TP

🧯 Bridge Rejection Conditions
yaml
복사
편집
no_bridge_conditions:
  - Previous TP ended in panic, collapse, or emotional override
  - Signal re-entry is forced without structural basis
  - Emotion = Regret / Euphoria / Revenge
  - Timeframe divergence across rhythm states
  - Compression not reset → structure still congested

📈 Flow Scenarios
| Prior Exit                                 | Bridge Available? | Reason                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| TP closed in flow, new rhythm forming      | ✅ Yes             | Clean re-alignment        |
| TP collapsed under volatility              | ❌ No              | Structure broken          |
| Signal returns immediately, but misaligned | ❌ No              | Forced entry              |
| Premonition retriggers with sync           | ✅ Yes             | Flow continuation         |
| Emotion not stabilized                     | ❌ No              | Execution still distorted |

🧠 Execution Logic
def detect_bridge():
    if previous_tp_closed_cleanly and emotion_stable:
        if signal_cluster_within_range and alignment_appears():
            return True
    return False
