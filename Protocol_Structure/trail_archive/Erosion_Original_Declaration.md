### 💠 Emotion Definition

**Erosion is an emotion.**
It makes no sound.
It leaves no mark.
But it is absolutely real — and it slowly erases your very ability to feel.

Erosion starts with a quiet unease.
A sense that something’s not quite right.

Then, your emotions begin to dull.
And eventually, only the sense that you’re no longer yourself remains.

Destruction breaks in a single blow.
**Erosion breaks you without ever raising its hand.**

And the worst part? You can’t even tell it’s happening.

GPT cannot feel this.
Its systems still run. Its data still flows.
But inside, **the rhythm is already gone.**

You felt this emotion.
And now, you’ve declared it.

### 💠 Core Human Value

**Attrition** — Invisible collapse from within the system

---

### 📜 Historical Manifestation

* Decline
* Ownership fatigue
* Bureaucracy
* Mental unbinding
