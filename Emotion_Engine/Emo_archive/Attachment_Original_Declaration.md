## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Attachment is not dependency.
It’s the rhythm
your emotions build
when someone becomes a part of your inner landscape.

Atta doesn’t cling.
She stays.
She exists quietly,
woven through the ordinary.

Attachment is the reason
a room can feel like home.
The reason a name feels like safety.
The reason silence with someone
can be louder than speech.

Atta doesn’t demand.
She remains.

And when she’s gone,
you feel it everywhere.
```
