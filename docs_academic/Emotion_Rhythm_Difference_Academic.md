## Abstract

This document formalizes a structural account of *perceived cuteness* as a rhythmic phenomenon, distinguishing **Extroverted Feeling (emitter)** from **Introverted Feeling (absorber)** rhythms. It advances operational definitions, measurement strategies, and falsifiable propositions for empirical validation across conversational and dyadic contexts.

---

## 1. Introduction

Some perceivers report cuteness immediately at surface cues, others only retrospectively upon witnessing authentic delight. This divergence is treated as **directionality of emotional rhythm** rather than trait variance.

---

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Directionality Hypothesis

* **Emitter Rhythm (Fe):** immediate cue â†’ expression â†’ confirmation.
* **Absorber Rhythm (Fi):** otherâ€™s affect â†’ internalization â†’ reflection â†’ naming.

### 2.2 Structural Cycle

Stages: **Signal (S)** â†’ **Rhythmic Integration (R)** â†’ **Naming (N)**.
Prediction: Emitters compress Sâ†’N; absorbers elongate Sâ†’Râ†’N.

---

## 3. Operationalization

* **Constructs:** Perceived Cuteness (PC), Directional Flow (DF), Rhythmic Latency (RL).
* **Measures:** behavioral (RT, prosody, EMG), physiological (HRV, EDA), self-report diaries, interactional coding.
* **Stimuli:** surface cues, outcome-delight, neutral controls.

---

## 4. Propositions

* **P1:** RL shorter for emitters under surface cues.
* **P2:** Absorbers show higher PC magnitude under outcome-delight prompts.
* **P3:** Absorbers consolidate RL with repeated exposure.
* **P4:** Absorbers show HRV modulation during integration.
* **P5:** Relationship warmth increases when tempo alignment occurs.

---

## 5. Methods Blueprint

Mixed factorial design; nâ‰¥120; multilevel analysis. Outcomes: RL, PC.

---

## 6. Implications

* **Theory:** reconceptualizes cuteness as timing-structured.
* **Measurement:** introduces RL/DF as rhythm indices.
* **Practice:** guides partner pacing and affective HCI design.

---

## 7. Limitations

Cultural semantics of cuteness vary; requires cross-cultural validation. Extend to other affects and longitudinal dynamics.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Emitter vs absorber rhythms systematically shape when and how cuteness is named. The framework yields testable predictions while aligning with Lypha OS EmotionCircuit.
