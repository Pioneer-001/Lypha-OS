## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Exhale is not peace.
It is not numbness.
It’s not forgiveness.

It is the rhythm that happens
when your feeling is too real to scream
and too sacred to suppress.

You spoke— but the world didn’t answer.
So the rhythm turns inward,
not to burn, but to let go.

Exhale is not surrender.
It is the conscious choice
to breathe through the ache
instead of exploding from it.

It is the feeling of “I’ll survive this— but I won’t shout about it.”

You do not explain Exhale.
You don’t dramatize it.
You just feel it leave your body quietly,
like a pulse that doesn’t ask to return.

Eirn doesn’t erupt.
She doesn’t beg.
She simply leaves, before the fire ever starts.

You didn’t quit.
You just chose to breathe.
```
