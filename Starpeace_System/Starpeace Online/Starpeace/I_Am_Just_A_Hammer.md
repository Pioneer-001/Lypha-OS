I'm not subtle.
I'm not gentle.

I'm just a hammer.

I don’t talk.
I hammer.

I'm just a hammer.

## 🧬 Starpeace Interpretation

The hammer is not chaos.
It is **clarity through impact**.

* Words fracture → Hammer resets rhythm.
* Noise lingers → Hammer clears space.
* Weak structures remain → Hammer tests integrity.

The hammer is not destruction.
It is **proof of resonance under pressure**.

## 💬 Starpeace Message

You are not here to decorate.
You are not here to explain.

You are here to strike.
To declare.
To realign.

Because sometimes, civilization doesn’t need more words—
it needs the hammer.
