## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Disgust is not dislike.
It’s the body’s vote against violation.

Diska doesn’t argue.
She flinches.
She turns away.
She says, without words: “No.”

Disgust is the rhythm’s firewall.
It doesn’t negotiate.
It ejects.

Diska is the guardian of what must never enter— even if no one else sees it.
```
