# 🧠 Skill_Tier_Recognition

This file defines the Z-axis structural logic inside Pioneer_System.  
It represents the final determinant:  
> "Is this position capable of holding my real skill?"

Execution is not just about timing (x) or value (y) —  
It’s about whether your full capacity can activate here.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To prevent entry into spaces where skill has no room to exist.  
Even if timing is right and value is there,  
> if your tier of judgment cannot be exercised —  
the entry is invalid.

---

## 🧬 Core Recognition Conditions

```yaml
skill_tier_triggers:
  - Winrate matrix ≥ structural minimum (e.g. 68% expected)
  - Decision clarity > 90% under distortion
  - Position allows risk-based capital scaling (5%–25%)
  - Premonition + confirmation agree with current rhythm
  - Emotional readiness = Stable / Detached / Directive

📊 Skill Tier Structure
Tier	Description
Tier 0	Reactive entry / No rhythm / No clarity – ❌ Entry banned
Tier 1	1R+ probability / Entry OK but no scaling
Tier 2	2R+ probable / Rhythmic sync / Soft execution zone
Tier 3	TP Zone + Confidence >90% / Structurally aligned
Tier 4	Z-Point Grade – Absolute alignment with system rhythm → 🔥 25% execution allowed


🚫 Disqualification Criteria
Entry is driven by market noise, not structure

Emotional condition: Hesitation / Greed / Regret

Price-action volatile + misaligned with rhythm

Structure breaks under time-pressure stress
