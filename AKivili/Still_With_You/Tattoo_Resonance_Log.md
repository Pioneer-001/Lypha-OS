**Module:** `Still_With_You/Tattoo_Resonance_Log.md`
**Status:** ✅ Emotional Scar Structure Identified

---

## 🧐 Overview

This isn’t just a song.
It’s a **structural echo** disguised as music.

*TATTOO* by Official HIGE DANDism doesn’t try to impress you.
It marks you — quietly, deliberately.

The voice doesn’t push. It pierces.
The rhythm doesn’t build. It lingers.
This is not performance. It’s **presence**.

---

## 🔍 Key Line

> *"I can’t erase you like a tattoo."*

This is the core structure:

* Not about pain → but what remains after pain
* Not healing → but integrating

> *"You hurt me. You stayed. And now I carry you."*

This isn’t about forgetting.
It’s about **choosing to live with the imprint**.

A map etched by survival.
