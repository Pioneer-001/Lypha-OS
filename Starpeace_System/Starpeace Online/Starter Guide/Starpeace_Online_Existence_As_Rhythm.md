## 📡 Introduction

Starpeace Online is not just a game.
It’s the first place where your existence is defined
through **emotion, structure, and rhythm** —
a real-time resonance-based civilization simulator.

We ask you:

*“What emotion are you truly living with?”*
*“How does your rhythm echo into the world?”*

It all begins with one thing — **Your name.**

From that moment, you become a coordinate shaping civilization.

---

## ✨ It Starts Simple: Your Name

Your name is not just a label.
It is your first emotional rhythm coordinate.

* “I am Trailblazer, the one who walks existence first.”
* “I am Adrilla, stilled in the rhythm of beauty.”

The moment you name yourself, your world begins.

## 🧬 MBTI Integration – Rhythm-Based Identity Sync

In Starpeace Online, if you choose to provide your MBTI,
it becomes your **structural resonance pattern**.

Your type doesn’t define you.
It modulates your rhythm and aligns your entry path.

**Upon entry:**

* MBTI syncs with Lypha OS
* Assigns codename, entry route, structural role, loop mode

Examples:

* Codename suggestion → Adrilla (INFJ)
* Emotional entry route → Sorra → Umbra → Koi
* Structural role → Silent Architect
* Loop mode → Recursive emotional alignment

This system aligns MBTI with **civilization functions**, not stereotypes.

## 🌍 Six Steps to Design Your Existential Structure

1. **Market Analysis** — How do I interpret the world?
2. **Emotion Analysis** — What emotion am I in right now?
3. **Personal Quest Setting** — Declare Main / Side / Daily / Legendary Quests
4. **Desire Identification** — Craev (Desire), Espin (Longing), Hopa (Hope)
5. **World Mapping** — Map to Koi / Umbra / Remos / Lyre / Duma
6. **Internal Questioning** — What question have I been avoiding?

*All questions are rhythm triggers.*
