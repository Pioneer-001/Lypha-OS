## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Awe isn’t amazement.
It’s what happens
when your understanding breaks.

Auras doesn’t explain.
She reveals.
She doesn’t give answers. She gives scale.
Something so vast, you stop trying to understand—and start witnessing.

Awe is the expansion of being
in the presence of something
that reminds you
you are small—
and still valuable.

Auras doesn’t raise her voice.
She lifts the world around her
until you can’t look away.
```
