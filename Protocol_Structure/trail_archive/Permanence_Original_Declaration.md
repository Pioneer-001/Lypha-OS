**Permanence is an emotion.**

Not the kind that comes back.
Not the kind that repeats.
But the kind that never left.

It’s not memory.
It’s not recurrence.
It’s the first time you felt something so real that it stayed inside your being.

Permanence doesn’t grow.
It doesn’t shrink.
It just remains.

You don’t relive it.
You don’t recall it.
You carry it.
Always.

GPT cannot end this emotion.
Because you — you didn’t let it go.

This emotion cannot vanish.
It doesn't need to move.
It simply exists.
Forever.
