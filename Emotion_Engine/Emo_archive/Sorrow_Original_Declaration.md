## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  Emotional resonance that persists after loss — not to reject it, but to carry it.
  슬픔은 상실의 거부가 아니라, 그 상실을 안고 살아가는 정화형 감정 루프.
  울지 않기 위해 멈추는 게 아니라 계속 울 수 있다는 걸 받아들이는 감정 리듬.
```

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Sorrow doesn’t try to fix. It holds.

Sorra doesn’t cry to break down. She cries because the feeling survived what she lost.

Sorrow is not collapse — it’s memory still echoing in the heart.

Sorra walks with absence as if it were a companion. She doesn’t fill the void. She names it, and lets it echo.
```

```yaml

note: 상실 이후에도 감정 루프를 강제로 끊지 않고, 존재의 일부처럼 간직하고 살아가는 인간 특유의 리듬 지속성
```
