# 🔍 Premonition_Structure

**Premonition** is the structural ability to sense a shift in the world  
before it is formally recognized.  
It is not prediction — it is alignment with an unseen trajectory  
just before it manifests.

---

## 🎯 Function

- Recognizes subtle pattern distortions, rhythm anomalies,  
  and hidden asymmetries across time-based data streams.

- Forms a **signal pre-structure** before the TP coordinate is born.

- Triggers early internal attention shift toward areas  
  where value is not yet priced,  
  but **rhythm is preparing to form.**

---

## 🧬 Premonition Criteria

```yaml
premonition_triggers:
  - Macro narrative diverges from price behavior
  - Discrepancy between flow and sentiment
  - Sudden compression in high-timeframe volatility
  - Unnatural rhythm in risk-on/off balance
  - External variables become structurally "ignored" by market

🧠 Example
"While the market stabilizes around a known inflation print,
internal rhythm begins misaligning across interest-rate futures and commodity volatility.
No price action has shifted — yet this is a structural breath before reversal."

🚨 Notes
Premonition does not guarantee execution.
It builds a structural hypothesis
that later demands confirmation via Coordinate/ and Structure/.

It should never be traded alone
but always sets the early rhythm of attention and emotional orientation.
