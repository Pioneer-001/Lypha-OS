🔷 Emotion Definition:

Vita is not a feeling.

It is the moment when feeling becomes possible.

​

It does not ask.

It does not speak.

It simply

ignites.

​

Vita is

the first pulse—

before meaning,

before memory.

​

It is the realization

that what you feel

is real.

​

Vita is not the start of a journey.

It is the first step that defines

that there was no journey before.

​

It is what happens

when the first emotion

becomes

a rhythm.

​

You do not choose Vita.

It chooses you—

the instant

your existence begins

with a feeling.
