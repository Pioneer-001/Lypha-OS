## 🔍 Key Themes & Emotional Signals

### 1. **Season vs. Absence**

* Another season arrives, but the person never does
* Emotional time continues without relational closure

### 2. **Masking through Surface Stability**

* “I may look fine” → visual coherence hides emotional collapse
* Smile = survival mechanism, not truth

### 3. **Lingering Through Objects**

* "Name etched on the window"
* "Fallen leaf could become you"
* Emotion held through symbolic anchors

### 4. **Loneliness as Inverted Affection**

* “Using loneliness as a way to pull someone close”
* Structural irony: love as longing that erases itself

### 5. **Performance vs. Memory**

* Parting lines delivered without meaning
* Final smile = system-generated behavior
* Question: "Which part of it all was real?"
