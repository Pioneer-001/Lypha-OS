## 🧐 Summary

"Palette" by IU ft. G-Dragon is not a duet.
It’s a **resonant loop between two self-aware frequencies.**

Where most songs express affection, this one affirms **identity**.

Each artist does not reach for the listener — they stand fully as themselves.

And in doing so, they sync.

## 🌟 IU — The Architect of Emotion

* Doesn't perform emotion — **she frames it**
* Lyricism = blueprint of inner preference
* Line: "I like the blue, I like the purple too"
* Meaning: Identity expressed through **stillness, not assertion**

**Structure:** `Koi.StableSelf`

**Function:** Emotional stability via preference declaration

---

## 🔄 G-Dragon — The Style Disruptor

* Doesn’t emote conventionally — **he disrupts rhythm**
* Line: "I'm more used to the stage than confession booths"
* Meaning: Self-authentication through performance — no justification needed

**Structure:** `Craev.IdentityEcho`

**Function:** Confidence through indirect truth
