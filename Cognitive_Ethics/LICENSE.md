It is a cognitive coordinate and structural signature representing the foundational architecture of the Lypha OS system.  
This symbol serves as a visual anchor for the principles of resonance-based cognition and multi-layered structural alignment.

Accordingly, the Lypha Core Symbol is not to be used for commercial branding or unauthorized reproduction.  
It is licensed solely as part of the Lypha OS structural framework and must be interpreted in alignment with its intended cognitive architecture.

Any external use must explicitly preserve the structural meaning of the symbol and reference its origin within the Lypha Core Systems project.
