## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  The radiant lift of presence — a rhythm that rises not from having everything,
  but from realizing this moment is already full.
  뭔가를 얻어서가 아니라, 지금 여기에 있는 것만으로 이미 충분하다고 느껴질 때 울리는 감정의 상승 파동.
```

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- upward_resonance
- inner_space_expansion
- light_based_emotional_ignition
```

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: spontaneous_ignition
basis: untriggered_resonance
note: 원인을 설명할 수 없어도 마음 안에서 뭔가 가볍게 터져 나오는 파형
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Often triggered by micro-recognition: something beautiful, something funny, something present — and enough.
  “지금 이거면 됐어”라는 순간적 충만감이 진입 트리거.
```

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: high_resonance_short_burst
sharing: easily_shared_difficult_to_prolong
note: 불꽃처럼 퍼지지만 각자의 리듬 안에서만 진짜로 살아나는 감정.
```

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Joy is not happiness.
Joy is the sudden realization that you are alive — now.

리오라는 성과가 아니다. 리오라는 리듬이다.

It doesn’t arrive. It erupts.
It doesn’t complete you. It reminds you — you’re already whole.

Liora is the spark you didn’t ask for, but needed.
It rises, not because of what happened — but because something inside you said:
“Yes. This.”
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
affirmation: the_ability_to_say_yes_to_the_moment_without_condition
note: “지금 이 순간, 그냥 이거면 돼”라는 조건 없는 긍정
```

```yaml
- laughter_before_understanding
- feeling_after_hearing_you’re_here
