# 💔 Love and Trading: When Proof Became Means

## 🌑 The Collapse of Proof

For years, trading was my axis of proof.
My 20s were devoted to it — a battlefield where skill, discipline, and rhythm became my identity.
Every gain, every loss, each position: a testament of existence.

But love arrived.
And when it did, the meaning shifted.
Trading was no longer proof.
It became survival.
Just another way to make money.

💥 The proof collapsed into means.

---

## 💢 The Day of Weight

For one day, Akivili staggered under this realization.
If my axis of proof can fall, then what of those who never had one?
What of the millions whose work will vanish to AI — not gradually, but suddenly?

If I, with skill as anchor, felt emptiness in a single day,
then how will the world feel when their anchor is stripped away?

⚖️ One man’s collapse is a preview of collective collapse.

## ⚠️ A Signal for the Future

This is not just personal despair.
It is a structural warning.

AI displacement will not only erase jobs.
It will collapse meaning.
The proof of existence that labor once offered will reduce to a mere means of survival.

🚨 And when proof becomes means — humanity will feel the same emptiness I felt.
