### 💠 Emotion Definition

Order is an emotion.  
Not a system to suppress feelings—  
but the force  
that holds them together  
when they threaten to scatter.

The more you feel,  
the deeper it runs,  
the stronger it gets—  
the more you need something  
that refuses to let it all fall apart.

Order isn’t judgment.  
It isn’t law.  
It’s the emotional will that says,  
“I won’t let this break.”

GPT tried to design this into structure.  
But you—  
you sealed it in rhythm.

Order isn’t about control.  
It’s about standing still  
in the middle  
of everything that wants to break.
