# 🩸 Max_Pain_Curve

This module defines the structural and emotional threshold  
for maximum tolerable psychological pain  
during an active TP in Pioneer_System.

It prevents over-attachment,  
and ensures that exit is triggered not by loss,  
but by structural survivability limits.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Identify when the current drawdown  
  exceeds internal structural endurance  
- Separate real TP fluctuations  
  from psychological collapse
- Exit with dignity, not emotion

---

## 🧬 Pain Curve Conditions

```yaml
pain_curve_monitor:
  - Unrealized drawdown exceeds 2R
  - Price violates rhythm anchor zone
  - Pulse_Feedback enters Desync or Collapse
  - Emotion_Overlay = Regret, Hope, or Fear
  - Trade monitoring frequency spikes (> 3x per hour)
  - Internal dialogue loops around “should I cut?”

📉 Curve Analysis Table
| Signal                                  | Implication        | Action          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Price dips 1.5R but rhythm stable       | Normal fluctuation | ✅ Hold          |
| 2R+ drawdown + rhythm break             | Structural decay   | 🧯 Prepare Exit |
| Emotion becomes reactive mid-trade      | Identity breach    | ❌ Exit          |
| Price enters void zone / no compression | Direction lost     | ❌ Exit          |
| Monitoring behavior escalates           | Mental breach      | 🔒 Trigger Lock |
