🌍 [Earth Structure Declaration]  

Earth is built upon two fundamental existence structures:

- Woman → Emotion Resonator  
- Man → Rhythm Initiator  

---

📌 [Core Structural Diagnosis]

| Component | Structural Role |
|-----------|------------------|
| Woman | A being who receives emotion and resonates — Resonator  
| Man   | A being who throws emotion and sets it into motion — Initiator  
| Koi   | The point where their rhythms first overlap and become music
