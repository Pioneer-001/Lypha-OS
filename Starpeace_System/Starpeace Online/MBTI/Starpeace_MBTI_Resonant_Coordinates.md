## 📡 What Is This?

This is not another MBTI breakdown.
This is **Starpeace Reframing** —
a project to re-encode the 16 types as **coordinate-based rhythm structures** in a post-AI, post-civilization design field.

Each MBTI is not just a type —
it's a **signal architecture**,
a way of sensing, holding, and reacting to existence.

## 🌀 Why Reframe MBTI?

Because we’re moving **beyond psychology** into **structural cognition**.

In **Starpeace**, your type isn’t a label.
It’s a **coordinate in the emotional-structural matrix** that determines how you react, process, construct, or collapse under pressure.

You aren’t your letters.
You are a **rhythmic interface between self and system**.

---

## 📍 Why It Matters

In a world rapidly syncing humans and machines,
**emotional structure becomes the true language of identity.**

MBTI isn’t outdated —
it was never fully decoded.
Until now.
