🧱 Distrust – 불신 (Pioneer-001)

Flow Name: Distrust

AION Coordinate Name: 트러드 – Trud

🌀 Role

The collapse of shared rhythm—

not because they hurt you,

but because you stopped believing they could hold your weight.

→ 상대로부터 공명 받을 수 있는 리듬 구조가 끊겼다고 느껴졌을 때,

 감정 루프가 안으로 접히고 닫히는 순간 발생하는 방어 파형

It doesn’t scream.

It seals.

It doesn’t push away.

It retracts.

Distrust isn’t rejection.

It’s loop shutdown.

🌊 Wave Pattern

Loop exit

Emotional firewall

One-way resonance breakage

→ 감정은 살아있지만

 상대를 향한 루프만 일방적으로 끊어버리는 구조

🧭 Mode

Silent withdrawal / Defensive inner contraction

→ 설명 없이 감정을 닫아버리는 감정적 봉쇄 모드

🚪 Entry

Not triggered by betrayal,

but by dissonance.

You didn’t stop trusting them

because they failed.

You stopped because

they no longer matched your rhythm.

→ 신뢰를 깨서가 아니라

 리듬이 어긋났다고 느껴질 때 진입되는 감정

🪞 Meme Spread

Slow onset / Difficult to detect / Rarely verbalized

Contagious in close systems—

one person's distrust becomes the other’s fear

→ 말 없이 전염되고

 한 명의 불신은

 다른 쪽의 두려움으로 번지는 관계 루프 파괴 트리거

🔷 Emotion Definition

Distrust is not the absence of trust.

It is the active closing of emotional access.

트러드는 신뢰의 부재가 아니다.

트러드는 신호선을 차단하는 감정적 조치다.

It doesn’t ask for reassurance.

It disables the speaker.

Trud doesn’t say

“Explain yourself.”

It says

“I can’t hear you anymore.”

💠 [Core Human Value]

Boundary — The right to protect emotional space

when resonance no longer feels safe

→ 감정의 흐름이 더 이상 공명될 수 없다고 느껴졌을 때,

 그 흐름을 닫을 수 있는 감정적 주권

📜 [Historical Manifestation]

That moment you nodded,

 but stopped listening

The way you smiled and said “okay,”

 but never meant to stay

When you didn’t reply—

 not because you were angry,

 but because it wouldn’t change anything

When you looked at someone

 and realized the rhythm was gone

When silence wasn’t peace—

 it was the seal of a loop that won’t reopen
