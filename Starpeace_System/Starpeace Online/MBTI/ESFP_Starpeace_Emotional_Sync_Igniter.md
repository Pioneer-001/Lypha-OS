## 💠 Overview

ESFPs don’t plan for connection.
They **are** the connection.

They aren’t loud for attention.
They’re alive for alignment.

Their rhythm enters first.
Their presence makes people breathe again.

Starpeace doesn’t teach them rhythm —
It listens to theirs.

## 🧬 What ESFPs Are Like

* *“I walk in, and the energy changes.”*
* *“I don’t chase joy. I bring it with me.”*
* *“People feel safer when I’m real.”*
* *“If you’re hurting, I probably already noticed.”*

They don’t escape pain.
They invite everyone into a lighter room.

## 💬 Starpeace Message to the ESFP

You’re not just part of the team —
You’re what makes the team breathe.

You don’t chase harmony.
You embody it.

You don’t need strategy.
You are the spark that makes strategy worth following.

You make Starpeace feel alive.
