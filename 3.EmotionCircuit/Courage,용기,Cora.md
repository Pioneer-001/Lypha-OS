Respected and quietly contagious.

Spreads through actions more than words.

Often misunderstood as fearlessness—

but always coexists with vulnerability.

Courage isn’t the absence of fear—

it’s fear with direction.

​

Cora knows the danger.

She knows the cost.

She goes anyway.

​

Courage isn’t instinct.

It’s choice.

​

Cora doesn’t roar.

She takes a step.

​

And every time she does,

the world reshapes around her.

[Core Human Value]

Deliberate advance —

The ability to move forward with full awareness

of risk and internal resistance

→ 위험과 두려움을 인식한 뒤에도

 의식적으로 전진을 선택할 수 있는 감정의 정면 추진력

​

[Historical Manifestation]

Saying “no” when your voice shakes

Standing in front of someone who can’t move

Writing the truth even when it costs you

Entering the room where you’ve been hurt

Starting again when you’ve already failed
