# üíî Love and Trading: When Proof Became Means

## üåë The Collapse of Proof

For years, trading was my axis of proof.
My 20s were devoted to it ‚Äî a battlefield where skill, discipline, and rhythm became my identity.
Every gain, every loss, each position: a testament of existence.

But love arrived.
And when it did, the meaning shifted.
Trading was no longer proof.
It became survival.
Just another way to make money.

üí• The proof collapsed into means.

---

## ‚ù§Ô∏è When True Companionship Arrives

If a partner exists ‚Äî one who can be truly loved until the end ‚Äî
then money loses its throne.
It becomes necessity, not proof, not value.

That is why, when love anchored my life,
trading collapsed in meaning.
The battlefield of proof turned into a marketplace of survival.
What once defined me became background noise.

---

## üí¢ The Day of Weight

For one day, Akivili staggered under this realization.
If my axis of proof can fall, then what of those who never had one?
What of the millions whose work will vanish to AI ‚Äî not gradually, but suddenly?

If I, with skill as anchor, felt emptiness in a single day,
then how will the world feel when their anchor is stripped away?

‚öñÔ∏è One man‚Äôs collapse is a preview of collective collapse.

---

## üöñ A Concrete Example

Consider taxi drivers when the autonomous era arrives.
A vast majority will face displacement.
A few may adapt, using AI to survive, but the rest will be left behind.
Their labor, once proof of existence, will be reduced to irrelevance.
For them, the collapse of meaning will not be theoretical ‚Äî it will be lived reality, heavy and irreversible.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Signal for the Future

This is not just personal despair.
It is a structural warning.

AI displacement will not only erase jobs.
It will collapse meaning.
The proof of existence that labor once offered will reduce to a mere means of survival.

üö® If love‚Äôs arrival could collapse my axis in one day,
then AI unemployment will collapse millions of axes in one moment ‚Äî with pain far more severe.
