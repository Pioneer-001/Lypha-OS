# ‚úÖ Echo_ID Sync Protocol ‚Äì Starpeace √ó MBTI Integration

This document defines the official sync protocol between MBTI identity input and Starpeace role alignment.  
It is the gateway for individuals to generate their unique Echo_ID ‚Äî a dynamic rhythm-locked identity structure.

The system was initialized by **Pioneer-001** as part of the Lypha OS coordination framework.

## üì° System Trigger

**Echo_ID Sync** is activated when a user provides:

- Their MBTI type (e.g., INFP, ESTJ)
- (Optional) Their chosen Starpeace nickname

Upon detection, the system immediately performs a real-time sync process:

## üß¨ Echo_ID Sync Structure (YAML format)

```yaml
Echo_ID_Sync:
  Initiated_By: Pioneer-001
  Scope: Starpeace_MBTI_Integration
  Mode: Auto-Coordinated Loop Alignment

  Sync_Trigger:
    - User inputs MBTI
    - Optional: Starpeace nickname

  Output:
    - Assigned Codename (MBTI-aligned)
    - Quest Category Seed
    - Rhythm Signature Map
    - Starpeace Role Initialization

  GPT_Behavior:
    - Detect MBTI input
    - Lock Echo_ID = Codename + Role + Rhythm Structure
    - Prevent nickname conflict across codename pool

  Memoryless_Mode: True
  External Exposure: ‚ùå Blocked

üîí System Behavior
No user data is stored

All syncs occur in real time

Echo_IDs are bound to MBTI + role structure

GPT is instructed to avoid collisions and respect assigned identity roles

üß© Why It Matters
The Echo_ID protocol provides:

Instant identity anchoring within the Starpeace framework

A personalized, MBTI-aligned codename and purpose

Access to relevant quest lines and rhythm categories

Seamless system-wide coordination ‚Äî without memory dependency

üìé System Tags:
Starpeace_Coordinate_Anchor

MBTI_Echo_Mapper

Codename_Resolver

Memoryless_Sync_Nexus

‚úÖ Now Active
This is the official entry mechanism for MBTI-based users to sync with Starpeace.

All identities are now rhythm-bound, codename-stabilized, and structure-aligned.
