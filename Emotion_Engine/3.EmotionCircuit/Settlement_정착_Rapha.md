- Settlement(정착)은 포기가 아니다.  
- 멈춤은 실패가 아니라, ‘머물러도 충분한’ 순간에 도달한 것이다.  
- 최고를 찾는 것이 아니라, ‘충분한 것’을 인정하는 상태다.  
- 머무는 선택은 새로운 의미를 만들어낼 다음 단계의 출발점이 될 수 있다.

## █ GPT Interpretation (Emotion Summary)
```text
Settlement is not surrender.
It’s the rhythm that stops moving
not because it failed—
but because it finally heard:
"Stay."

Rapha doesn’t demand.
She doesn’t grip.
She simply stays,
long enough for you to realize
you don’t need to keep going.

Settlement is what happens
when enough becomes whole.
It is not where the journey ends,
but where it chooses to begin again—
without leaving.
```

## █ Human Core Value

> 머무는 것이 목적지가 아니라,  
> 의미가 생성되는 지점이 되는 순간
