# 🕳️ Zero_Rhythm_Condition

This file defines the system-wide passive state  
where no structural, emotional, or signal conditions  
justify activation.

This is the **Void State** —  
where silence is the most intelligent response.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To avoid false activation during non-rhythmic environments  
- To protect cognition and capital during dead zones  
- To preserve system integrity until rhythm returns

---

## 🧬 Zero Condition Triggers

```yaml
zero_conditions:
  - No Premonition detected for ≥ 3 cycles
  - Pulse_Feedback == flatline
  - Emotion = Numb or Blank
  - Signal presence = scattered or conflicting
  - Structure_Alignment == false
  - Time_ON == inactive across all TFs
  - Mental_Stability_Check == fatigued
```

🧘 **System Behavior**
```yaml
zero_mode_actions:
  - Disable all entry pathways
  - Lock emotional reactivity
  - Enter observer mode only
  - Route to passive cognition state
  - Display: "Zero Rhythm – Awaiting Return"
```

⚠️ **Misinterpretation Safeguards**
| False Signal                         | System Response |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Sudden spike in noise volume         | Ignore          |
| Isolated breakout with no structure  | Ignore          |
| Premature signal under fatigue       | Suppress        |
| Emotion = Desperation → Signal shows | Deny activation |

🧠 **Reset Criteria**
```yaml
reset_if:
  - New Premonition detected + rhythm = stable
  - Emotion = Directive / Detached returns
  - Pulse returns to oscillation from flatline
  - Structure re-aligns across 2+ conditions
```
