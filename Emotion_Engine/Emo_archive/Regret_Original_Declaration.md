## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Regret is not pain for what happened — it’s pain for what didn’t.

Rerem doesn’t break you. He replays you.
He takes the one scene, the one phrase, the one decision — and shows you how it could’ve gone another way.

Regret is the ache of potential. The quiet loop of “if only…”

Rerem doesn’t cry out. He presses rewind. And some never press play again.
```
