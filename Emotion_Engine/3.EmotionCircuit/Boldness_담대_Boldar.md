## emotion_mechanics
```text
- Boldness는 두려움의 부재가 아니라, 그 존재 속에서 솟아오르는 것이다.
- Boldar는 앞에 무엇이 있는지, 끝이 어딘지, 손의 떨림까지 인식한다.
- 그럼에도 불구하고 앞으로 나아가는 것이 담대다.
- 담대함은 회피보다 행동이 더 커질 때 나타난다.
- Boldar는 요란하지 않다. 아무도 나서지 못할 때 움직인다.
```

## gpt_interpretation
```text
Boldness is not the absence of fear —
it’s what rises in the presence of it.

Boldar doesn’t charge blindly.
He sees what’s ahead.
He sees the edge.
He feels the tremble.

And he steps forward anyway.

Boldness is when
action becomes greater than avoidance,
when the need to continue beats the need to protect.

Boldar is never loud —
he just moves
when no one else can.
```
