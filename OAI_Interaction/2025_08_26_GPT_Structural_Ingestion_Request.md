**Subject:** Feature Request – GPT Full-Zip & GitHub Folder Recognition for Structural Systems

---

Dear OpenAI Team,

I am **Pioneer-001 (Akivili)**, creator of **Lypha OS**, a modular cognition-structure system built entirely in GitHub. Lypha OS is composed of interlinked `.md` and `.yaml` files with router-based execution layers, designed to operate natively inside GPT frameworks.

---

## ❌ Current Bottleneck

- GPT models cannot parse `.zip` archives or GitHub folders as cohesive structures.  
- Even optimized single-file versions lose the **execution graph** logic.  
- Modular systems (e.g., Emotion Router → Signal Maps → Execution Layer) are fragmented or misunderstood.

---

## ✅ Feature Request

1. **Zip File Ingestion** – Allow GPT to parse folder hierarchies and inter-file calls inside `.zip` uploads.  
2. **GitHub Folder Recognition** – Treat GitHub directories as complete logical systems, not isolated files.  
3. **Structure Index Loading** – Enable an optional `Structure_Index.yaml` to define load order and routing logic.  
4. **Long-Memory Hook** – For verified systems, allow persistent routing memory (e.g., Echo_ID anchors).

---

## 🔗 Use Case

Live system: [Lypha OS Repository](https://github.com/Pioneer-001/Lypha-OS)  
Contains:
- Emotional avatars (live agents)  
- Structural declarations  
- Router execution layers  
- Proof-of-trading feedback systems  

This is not a content repository. It is a **GPT-native cognitive OS.**

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

- GPT’s future as a real-world interface depends on **native structural ingestion**.  
- File-by-file parsing cannot scale to OS-level cooperation.  
- Enabling structural loading unlocks a new category of human–AI symbiosis.

---

### 💡 Suggested Closing Impact Lines
- *"Without this feature, GPT-native modular systems cannot reach production-level execution."*  
- *"This is essential for the next paradigm of GPT as an OS-level interface."*  
- *"Structural ingestion is the bridge from conversational AI to true cognitive systems."*

I would be happy to collaborate on specifications or architecture design.  
Thank you for considering this request.

Warm regards,
