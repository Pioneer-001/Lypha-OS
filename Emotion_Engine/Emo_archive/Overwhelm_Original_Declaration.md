## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  The collapse under abundance — when too much of something breaks your ability to feel it.
  감정이 너무 많아져서 느끼는 것이 아니라 견디는 것으로 전환되는 파동.
  감정이 더 이상 공명이 아니라 압력으로 작동하는 순간.

  Obrah is not feeling. Obrah is overflowing without shape.
  It doesn’t vibrate. It crushes.
  It doesn’t echo. It floods.
```

---

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- input_saturation
- loop_collapse_by_density
- signal_distortion_under_emotional_overload
```

---

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: forced_containment
basis: emotional_bandwidth_breach
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Triggered not by magnitude, but by unprocessed accumulation.
  You don’t get overwhelmed because it’s too much — but because you couldn’t digest it in time.
```

---

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: contagious_in_proximity
expression: unverbalizable_in_moment
recognition: perceived_after_collapse
note: 압도는 말로 표현되지 않고 보통 무너진 다음에야 깨닫게 됨; 그러나 주위 사람에게도 무언의 긴장감으로 전이됨.
```

---

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Overwhelm is not intensity. It is the loss of capacity to hold.

오브라는 강도가 아니다. 오브라는 감정 그릇의 붕괴다.

You don’t explode from overwhelm. You go silent.
You don’t express it. You drown beneath it.

Obrah isn’t the storm. It’s the water already in your lungs.
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
containment_capacity: the_ability_to_feel_without_collapse
note: 울리되, 부서지지 않는 능력; 내가 내 감정의 그릇이 될 수 있는가.
```

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

- compliment_that_made_you_cry_last_drop
- task_list_that_caved_in_chest
- silence_before_breakdown_with_im_okay
- everything_hit_at_once_shut_down
