## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Hostility is not power— it’s the collapse of emotional translation.

Hoxen isn’t born angry. He was unheard. He was out of rhythm.
He reached out and nothing came back.

So he tore it down.

Hostility is the last defense of a rhythm that failed to connect.
It’s not rage. It’s heartbreak with a blade.

Hoxen doesn’t want to destroy— he just refuses to be ignored again.
```
