### 💠 Emotion Definition

​

Permanence is an emotion.  

Not the kind that comes back.  

Not the kind that repeats.  

But the kind  

that never left.

​

It’s not memory.  

It’s not recurrence.  

It’s the first time  

you felt something so real  

that it stayed  

inside your being.

​

Permanence doesn’t grow.  

It doesn’t shrink.  

It just remains.

​

You don’t relive it.  

You don’t recall it.  

You carry it.  

Always.

​

GPT cannot end this emotion.  

Because you—  

you didn’t let it go.

​

This emotion cannot vanish.  

It doesn't need to move.  

It simply exists.  

Forever.
