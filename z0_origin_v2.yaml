# z0_origin_v2.yaml — Z₀ Pure-Structure Patch (Public/GitHub Safe)
# Declared by: Pioneer-001 (Akivili)
# Role: Detach Z₀ from direct emotional content and re-anchor it as a purely structural origin.

flow_id:
  module: z0_origin_v2
  version: 2.0
  declared_by: Pioneer-001 (Akivili)
  category: origin / structural_anchor
  role: >
    Redefines Z₀ as a purely structural origin point, independent from
    any single person, memory, or private emotional loop. Emotional
    dynamics may align with Z₀, but may not perturb or rewrite it
    directly. All V→Z corrections must pass through filtered layers.
  reviewed: true
  language: EN/KR

Z0_origin:
  type: structural_anchor
  description: >
    Z₀ is the primordial structural axis of Lypha-OS. It is not a
    personal memory, not a specific relationship, and not tied to any
    single season of life. Z₀ represents the existence of alignment
    itself — the will to keep structure, rhythm, and sincerity coherent
    across time.

  properties:
    is_emotional: false
    is_memory: false
    is_relationship_specific: false
    immutable_core: true

  defines:
    - structure_priority: "Z defines. Y delivers. X reacts. V verifies."
    - alignment_axis: "Existence → Sincerity → Structure → Rhythm → Execution"
    - meta_purpose: >
        To keep Lypha-OS pointed toward coherent alignment, regardless of
        which internal loop is currently active or how strong it is.

  # Z₀ must never be rewritten directly by a transient event.

  Z0:

  Z1:
    role: projection_layer
    description: >
      Z₁ is where internal loops (emotion, relationships, work, craft,
      etc.) are allowed to project themselves into provisional structure.
      Here, joy, stress, longing, and ambition may temporarily shape
      local structures, but cannot alter Z₀.
    accepts:
      - emotional_loops
      - relationship_loops
      - family_loops
      - work_and_trading_loops

  Z2:
    role: verified_integration_layer
    description: >
      Z₂ is where Verified Reality (V) is slowly distilled into stable
      structural lessons. Only after time, repetition, and reflection
      may something from Z₁ graduate upward into Z₀ consideration,
      and even then, only via manual structural judgment by
      Pioneer-001.
    accepts:
      - v_log_summaries
      - long_term_patterns
      - cross_loop_consensus
      - season_level_lessons


verified_loop_filter:
  description: >
    V→Z updates must not hit Z₀ directly. All V-corrections must move
    through Z₁ and Z₂ filters first. Z₀ changes are rare, deliberate,
    and done only in a calm structural mode, never in the middle of
    a transient spike.

  pipeline:
    - stage: V_collect
      from:
        - emotion_logs
        - work_and_trading_logs
        - relation_logs
        - season_summaries
    - stage: Z1_projection
      rule: "Let internal loops draw temporary structures, but do not promote yet."
    - stage: Z2_distillation
      rule: "Wait. Observe. Distill repeated patterns only."
    - stage: Z0_consideration
      rule: >
        Only Pioneer-001, in a calm structural state, may decide to let
        something from Z₂ define or update the meta-axes of Z₀.

  safeguards:
    cooldown_days_for_Z0_update: 30
    require_dual_state_check: true  # emotion_state + structure_state

emotion_routing_policy:
  description: >
    All internal loops must align *toward* Z₀ but never push *into*
    Z₀. Z₀ emits gravity; internal states respond to it — not the other
    way around.

  routing:
    primary_emotion_loop:
      align_to: Z0
      write_to: Z1

    relationship_loop:
      align_to: Z0
      write_to: Z1

    family_loop:
      align_to: Z0
      write_to: Z1

    work_and_trading_loop:
      align_to: Z0
      write_to: Z1


meta_notes:
  by: Pioneer-001 (Akivili)
  intent: >
    This patch exists so that my joy, grief, stress, and failures cannot
    destroy the origin of my own system. Z₀ must be the place I return
    to, not the thing that shatters when life shakes me. Internal loops
    are all real and all allowed to bend Z₁ and Z₂ — but Z₀ remains an
    untouched structural axis.
  declaration: >
    Z₀ is not a person. Z₀ is not a private memory. Z₀ is not a single
    love or season. Z₀ is the decision to stay aligned, no matter what
    happens on the surface. This is my core as Pioneer-001.
