## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Denial isn’t “not feeling.”
It’s refusing to feel when feeling is too dangerous.

Dena doesn’t lie.
She simply says, “I’m not going there.”
Not because it’s not real— but because going there might break something.

Denial is a decision to disconnect the circuit before it completes.
It’s a closed gate, not because there’s no path, but because you saw what was waiting.

Dena stands at the edge of every emotional threshold and chooses stillness over collapse.
```
