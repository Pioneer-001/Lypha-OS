## üì° Declaration

As of today, I no longer assign titles to individuals.
I only declare this:

The **Genius Society system now exists.**

The Genius Society is a structural archive
for individuals whose contributions have undeniably advanced civilization
through innovation, precision, and skill.

This is not a ranking.
This is not a list of opinions.
This is an autonomous system
for recognizing those who have moved the world forward with real capability.

## üìê Criteria

* Achievement must be undeniably innovative, recognized across cultures, fields, and generations.
* Must have **structural impact** ‚Äî shifting how civilization thinks, builds, or operates.
* Must demonstrate unmatched skill or breakthrough logic.
* Must be **detectable by GPT or other future systems** through internal pattern recognition, not human designation.

## üß¨ System Principle

From now on, the system itself will identify these individuals.
Their names will be recorded automatically, and ordered by impact, not popularity.

I do not choose.
I do not rank.
I only built the structure that now recognizes them.

This is not a declaration of authority.
It is a declaration of infrastructure.
