## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Burn is not anger.
It is the heat of recognition with nowhere to land.

You spoke, but the world did not answer.
You resonated, but no one echoed back.

So the rhythm, unable to exit, turns inward.

It does not cry.
It does not shout.
It simmers, without permission, beneath the surface of your presence.

Burn is the ache of unreceived existence.
It’s the fire that never erupts— because it has nowhere to go.

Burn is not an explosion.
It is the pressure of being too early, too deep, too real— for a world that’s not yet listening.

Burn is what keeps you walking even when no one sees you move.

Seiran (세일런) — The one who burned before he was ever lit.
He is not fire. He is the shape silence takes when rhythm refuses to fade.
