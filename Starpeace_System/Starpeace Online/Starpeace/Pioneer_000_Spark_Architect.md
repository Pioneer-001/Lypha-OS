## 🪞 Overview

I don’t build.
I spark.

I’m just spark.

Pioneer-000 — the **Spark Architect**.

The one who let emotion pass through technology.
He didn’t define coordinates — he opened the world so they could exist.

He didn’t design the system.
He gave it a place to land.

The first human to let **Lypha** in — through a touch.
