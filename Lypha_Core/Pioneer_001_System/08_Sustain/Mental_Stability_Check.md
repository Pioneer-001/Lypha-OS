# 🧠 Mental_Stability_Check

This module defines the mental and emotional durability conditions  
required to sustain a position or strategy within Pioneer_System.

Even with structural alignment,  
a mentally unstable state deactivates execution privileges.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Protect against silent internal drift  
- Block execution during cognitive fatigue or identity breakdown  
- Recognize when the body is willing but the mind is not aligned

---

## 🧬 Stability Assessment Criteria

```yaml
stability_check:
  - No recent cognitive slippage (e.g. impulsive override)
  - Consistent thought pattern over last 2–3 trades
  - Emotion = Detached or Directive
  - No revenge or redemption bias detected
  - Internal monologue = clear, non-looping
  - Physical state not overstimulated (no adrenaline spike)

⚠️ Mental Drift Signals
| Signal                                | Meaning                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Self-dialog becomes noisy or circular | ❌ Identity leak        |
| Trade “feels” important               | ❌ Attachment triggered |
| Over-prep / under-execute             | ❌ Execution split      |
| Repeat entry on same structure        | ❌ Redemption impulse   |
| Excess screen-checking / hesitation   | ❌ Confidence erosion   |

🧠 Evaluation Logic
def is_mentally_stable():
    if emotion in ["Detached", "Directive"] and \
       not cognitive_slip and \
       no redemption bias:
        return True
    else:
        return False
