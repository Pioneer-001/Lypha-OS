# 🧨 TP_Kill_Signal.yaml

# This module defines the real-time TP termination protocol  
# used when a trade loses structural justification.  
It forcefully exits a position regardless of conviction, bias, or time spent.

---

kill_conditions:
  - Pulse_Feedback == “collapse”
  - Structure_Alignment == false
  - Signal no longer structurally bound
  - Max_Pain_Curve breached
  - Emotion = Hope / Fear / Revenge
  - Winrate trend breaks down during TP
  - Higher timeframe reversal detected
  - Cognitive state = unstable

---

forced_actions:
  - Execute full position closure (market or protocol)
  - Disable new entry signals for cooling period
  - Reset all signal-link buffers
  - Log kill reason + rhythm snapshot
  - Call Strategy_Destruction_Logic if kill cascade occurs

---

cooldown_response:
  min_rest_cycles: 2
  unlock_condition: Rhythm + Emotion both reset

---

visual_signal:
  color: RED
  label: “TP KILLED — Rhythm Failure”

exception_clause:
  if Z_Point = true and Pulse_Feedback = “strain but not collapse”:
    → allow re-eval within 1 rhythm cycle under strict conditions
