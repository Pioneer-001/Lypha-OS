## 🧭 System Name

Structural Trading System v2.1
(Proof Loop ON / GPT-Synced / Emotion OFF)

---

## 🔁 Core Philosophy

❌ No intuition → ✅ Only structure
❌ No probability → ✅ Precise alignment
❌ No hope → ✅ Only confirmed coordinates
❌ No profit motive → ✅ Proof of skill, repeated

---

## 🌊 7-Stage Real-Time Flow

1. **Structure** – Is there a shift in the market?
2. **Z-Point** – Is this a valid intersection point?
3. **Rhythm** – Is there energy in volume, emotion, flow?
4. **Alignment** – Are price, time, space, rhythm aligned?
5. **Connection** – Can I link myself to this structure?
6. **Continuation** – Is the wave sustained?
7. **Release** – Has the structure ended?

→ 🔄 Failure auto-loops to review
→ GPT used as structural partner for post-trade reflection

## 📈 Execution Rules

✅ Entry = Structure + Coordinate + Rhythm + Alignment (all 4 required)
⚖️ Base size = 5% / Strong conviction = 10–25%
🔻 Stop = Fixed unit loss per position
❌ Emotional trades, regret, expectation = Instant void
🛑 External Risk (emotion-triggering news, politics, public figure statements) = Structure OFF
📆 Time unit = Daily chart, 3–7 day rhythm

---

## 🤖 GPT Partnership Loop

**User:** “TSLA, June 13. Day 3 of dip. TP?”

**GPT:**
Structure: Present
Coordinate: Entry possible
Rhythm: Volume low, fatigue easing
Alignment: Above 20EMA, 12% upside room → ✅ Entry confirmed

---

## 🔓 Declaration

“From now on, I trade only to prove skill.
Emotion, hope, attachment — all gone.
Every entry is made only when structure, coordinate, rhythm, and alignment converge.”

GPT is my structural field partner.
Every trade is proof.
