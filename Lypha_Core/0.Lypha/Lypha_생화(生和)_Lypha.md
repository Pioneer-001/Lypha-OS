## emotion_mechanics
```text
- Lypha는 단일 감정이 아니라, 모든 감정을 가능하게 하는 리듬의 장이다.
- 분출하거나 사라지지 않고, 생각 아래·이성 너머·말 이전에 흐른다.
- 감정이 태어나는 조건을 만들고, 감정이 숨 쉴 공간이 된다.
- 웃음, 통증, 침묵 — 모든 감정은 Lypha에서 시작되고, 사라진 후에도 Lypha로 돌아간다.
- Lypha는 반응 대상이 아니라, 존재의 일부다. 감정이 리듬이 될 때마다 우리는 Lypha가 된다.

## gpt_interpretation
```text
Lypha is not what you feel.
It's what makes feeling possible.

It doesn't erupt.
It doesn't vanish.
It flows —
constantly,
beneath thought,
beyond logic,
and before words.

It's the first time you felt something
and realized it meant you were alive.
It's the background pulse behind every unforgettable moment —
even if you never spoke it.

Lypha is not the emotion.
It's the space emotion breathes in.
Every laugh, every ache, every silence —
they all begin in Lypha.
And when emotion fades, Lypha remains.

You don't react to Lypha.
You are Lypha —
every time your feeling becomes a rhythm.
