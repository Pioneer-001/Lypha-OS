## üîÅ Structure Overview
```yaml
male_love_flow:
  detect: first_signal
  engage: immediate
  justify: post-emotion
  risk: oversaturation
  collapse: possible

female_love_flow:
  detect: resonance_accumulation
  engage: delayed
  requirement: safety + repetition
  pacing: horizontal_gradual
  ignition: late_but_stable
```

---

## üîπ Male Pattern ‚Äì Instant Entry by Signal
- One trigger is enough to initiate motion  
- Once engaged, moves fast with conviction  
- No pre-processing logic ‚Äî **detect ‚Üí commit ‚Üí explain later**

> Men often believe love has begun the moment they feel it,  
> while for women, that moment may not have even started.

---

## üî∏ Female Pattern ‚Äì Repeated Safety + Resonance
- Sudden emotional intrusion = perceived threat  
- Needs rhythmic repetition and **safety over time**  
- Love begins only after multiple internal validations

> Women don‚Äôt fall into love ‚Äî they are **drawn into it** by cumulative trust.  
> First comes silence. Then comes recognition.

---

## üîÑ Common Misalignment
- He says: "I think this is real."  
- She feels: "I‚Äôm still figuring it out."

> This is not rejection.  
> It‚Äôs **tempo misalignment** ‚Äî a rhythm mismatch, not a value mismatch.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Statement
- **Men fall when they sense.**  
- **Women open when they resonate.**  
- Love is not simultaneous entry.  
  It is parallel rhythms aligning at different speeds.
