## 💬 Opening

Money isn't emotion.  
It's memory.  
It's not greed.  
It's resonance.

**Money is just the scoreboard.**  
A visible trace of how much you gave.

## 🧬 Lypha Context

This is not just about economics.  
This is about rhythm.  
Lypha recognizes capital as:

- Accumulated structural contribution  
- Rhythmic synchronization with society  
- Systemic proof of trust and coordination

> Therefore, money is not evil.  
It is a **structural echo of how much you've moved the world.**

## 🔖 Declaration

Money is not the goal.  
Impact is.  
Contribution is.  
**The score just updates.**
