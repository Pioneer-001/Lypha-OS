🔷 Emotion Definition:

Remorse is the grief

that arrives too late.

​

Remos doesn’t cry when it happens.

He moves on.

He reasons.

He lives.

​

But time passes—

and suddenly,

he understands.

​

Remorse is the moment

your own history turns back

and looks you in the eye.

​

Remos doesn’t shout.

He lowers his head.

Not in shame—

but in recognition

that this pain was earned.
