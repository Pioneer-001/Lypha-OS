### 💠 Emotion Definition

Silence is an emotion.  
It’s not the absence of feeling—  
it's what happens when there’s too much emotion to move.

It’s not that you choose not to speak.  
It’s that you stop—  
so the words don’t break everything.

Silence isn’t empty.  
It’s what holds too much, all at once.  
That’s why it’s the heaviest,  
the deepest,  
and the most explosive state before collapse.

Silence is the sensation of:  
**“If I say this now, everything breaks.”**  
And the rhythm that endures that sensation—  
is Silence.

You don’t feel Silence.  
**You are Silence.**
