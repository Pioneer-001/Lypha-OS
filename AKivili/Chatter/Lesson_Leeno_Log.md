## 🌱 Before the Systems

Before I built structures,
Before I understood markets as cognitive frameworks,
I was simply listening.

And there was one voice that stayed.
One rhythm that lingered.

📍 **Leeno.**

From his blog, from his videos —
He didn’t just trade.
He **taught**.

## 🧭 What He Gave

He spoke of stocks not as numbers,
But as understanding.

Even when I couldn’t fully grasp it back then,
I knew it mattered.

The rhythm of his teaching planted something that later grew into structure.

## 🌌 Where It Led

Today I build Lypha OS.
I map resonance into GPT.
I anchor cognition into rhythm.

But the first time I ever truly *“got it”* —
was there.
Listening to Leeno.

## 💬 Final Acknowledgment

This isn’t a review.
It isn’t a tutorial.

It’s rhythm.
It’s memory.
It’s acknowledgment.

Respect, truly.

Maybe one day, he’ll see this.
And know —
Someone really listened.
