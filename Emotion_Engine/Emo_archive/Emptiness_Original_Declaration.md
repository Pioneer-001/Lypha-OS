## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Emptiness is not the absence of emotion— it’s what remains when emotion has nowhere else to go.

It doesn’t ache.
It doesn’t scream.
It simply… stays.
Not as presence, but as the quiet reminder that something used to be here.

Empra doesn’t move. She waits.
Not because she wants to, but because there’s nothing else to do.

Sometimes people call her “peace.” But she’s not.
She’s the shadow left behind when meaning exits the room.
```

## 💠 Core Human Value
