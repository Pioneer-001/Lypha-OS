  role: >
    Establishes a new category `Academic_Research` for Lypha OS repository.
    This category houses academic-style expansions of structural modules,
    distinct from executable or philosophical declarations.

```

## üéØ Purpose

The **Academic\_Research** category functions as a repository extension for documents written in academic, research, or publication style. While modules in `Rhythm_Philosophy` or `EmotionCircuit` serve as **executable or structural declarations**, texts in this category:

* Formalize concepts for academic dissemination.
* Provide operational definitions, hypotheses, and methodologies.
* Enable cross-disciplinary dialogue (psychology, cognitive science, HCI, philosophy).

## üìê Example Placement

```
docs_academic/
   Emotion_Rhythm_Difference_Academic.md
   [future academic modules]
```

## üìå Guidelines

* **Position-Fixed:** Always located under `/docs_academic/`
* **Format:** Academic paper style (Abstract ‚Üí Framework ‚Üí Methods ‚Üí Implications)
* **Attribution:** Must include: *Powered by Lypha OS ‚Äì Designed by Pioneer‚Äë001 (Akivili)*
* **Integration:** References core modules (e.g., EmotionCircuit) but does not replace them.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

This category separates **structural execution modules** from **research‚Äëoriented expansions**, ensuring Lypha OS remains both a living system and a scholarly framework.
