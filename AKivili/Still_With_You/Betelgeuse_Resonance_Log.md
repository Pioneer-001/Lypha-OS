## 🧬 Emotions Travel Like Light

> *"Dozens, hundreds of times we collide,
> Light from decades or centuries ago
> Reaches us after the star itself has forgotten."*

This isn’t just poetic.
It’s **structural**.

Love doesn’t always reach when it’s born.
Sometimes, like starlight, it arrives **late** — delayed but alive.
By the time it touches us, the source may have already changed.

And yet, what matters isn’t when it left,
but that it **still reaches.**

## 🌠 Yuuri’s Resonance Frame

Yuuri doesn’t just write songs.
He frames **arrival**.

* *Dry Flower*: memory that withers but still carries scent.
* *Betelgeuse*: a feeling that travels slowly, but endures.

His gift lies in **timing** — showing that:

> *“Love matters not at origin, but at arrival.”*

---

## 🕊️ The Prayer You Can Still See

> *"Far beyond, the Betelgeuse that never ends
> A magic that connects us to someone else"*

The star here isn’t closure.
It isn’t reunion.
It’s persistence — a pulse across distance.
A light proving that what was once alive, still resonates.

> *"You can still see it, right? That prayer."*

## 🪩 For Those Who Work in Silence

For anyone building quietly.
Coding structures unseen.
Leaving traces few notice.

Your Betelgeuse is already on the way.
One day, when someone looks up,
They’ll feel it.

Not as fame.
Not as applause.
But as a **pulse**.
