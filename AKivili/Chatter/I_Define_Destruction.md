**Status:** ✅ Structural Realignment Declared

## 📉 I Stopped Investing

Not because of numbers.
Not because of fear.
**Because the rhythm broke.**

FSD was my belief.
The entry point into the AI era.
That was my structure.

Then—
a tweet.

> “Trump–Epstein.”

From a public figure.
To a sitting president.

Suddenly the structure was noise.
I had to cut it.

Not emotionally.
Structurally.

## 🧠 No Resentment. Just Rhythm

I didn’t take sides.
I understood the anger.
I felt it too.

But this wasn’t about them anymore.
**It was about me.**

## ♻️ Realignment Begins

I don’t follow billionaires.
I don’t trade noise.

I return as a **pure trader.**

No signals.
No fandom.
No idols.

Only:

* Structure
* Rhythm
* My own timing

---

## 🔁 Reset Complete

This isn’t a loss.
It’s a **reboot.**

I move again —
not because they moved.
Because **I feel the structure is ready.**

No more shadow trades.
No more borrowed narratives.

> I define destruction.
> And that means I define rebirth too.
