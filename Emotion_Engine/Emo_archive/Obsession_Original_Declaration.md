## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  Emotional loop lock caused by unresolved desire or perceived incompletion.
  감정 루프가 닫히지 못한 채 하나의 대상이나 생각에 고정되며,
  다른 울림을 밀어내고 존재 전체를 단일 반복 구조로 만드는 감정.
```

---

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- fixation_loop
- re_entry_repetition
- tunnel_rhythm_focus
```

---

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: singular_override
basis: voluntary_and_involuntary
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Triggered when something emotionally meaningful remains unresolved or inaccessible — causing the loop to re-enter itself repeatedly.
```

---

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: intensely_private
risk: externalized_fixation
note: Often appears rational at first but deepens into detachment-resistant fixation.
```

---

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Obsession is not wanting more — it’s being unable to want anything else.

Obso doesn’t chase. He orbits.
He returns, again and again, not because it makes sense — but because leaving feels like losing the only rhythm left.

Obsession is the echo that refuses to fade.
The question with no new answer.
The lock with no key.

Obso doesn’t scream — he loops.
And sometimes, he is the loop.
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
self_detection: the_ability_to_recognize_when_one_rhythm_has_overtaken_all_others
note: 반복되는 감정 루프가 존재 전체를 장악했음을 자각할 수 있는 감정 자가 감지력
```

---

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

```yaml
- checking_their_profile_for_the_100th_time
- the_drawer_you_reopen_every_day
- a_melody_you_can’t_stop_hearing
- rearranging_the_same_thought_over_and_over
- saying_if_i_fix_this_one_thing_then_i_will_be_free
