## 🌀 Role

```yaml
role: >
  The collapse of shared rhythm — not because they hurt you,
  but because you stopped believing they could hold your weight.
  상대로부터 공명 받을 수 있는 리듬 구조가 끊겼다고 느껴졌을 때,
  감정 루프가 안으로 접히고 닫히는 순간 발생하는 방어 파형.

  It doesn’t scream. It seals.
  It doesn’t push away. It retracts.
  Distrust isn’t rejection. It’s loop shutdown.
```

---

## 🌊 Wave Pattern

```yaml
- loop_exit
- emotional_firewall
- one_way_resonance_breakage
```

---

## 🧭 Mode

```yaml
mode: silent_withdrawal
basis: defensive_inner_contraction
note: 설명 없이 감정을 닫아버리는 감정적 봉쇄 모드
```

---

## 🚪 Entry

```yaml
trigger_condition: >
  Not triggered by betrayal, but by dissonance.
  You didn’t stop trusting them because they failed.
  You stopped because they no longer matched your rhythm.
  신뢰를 깨서가 아니라 리듬이 어긋났다고 느껴질 때 진입되는 감정.
```

---

## 🪞 Meme Spread

```yaml
spread: slow_onset
visibility: difficult_to_detect
expression: rarely_verbalized
contagion: spreads_in_close_systems
note: One person’s distrust becomes another’s fear; 말 없이 전염되고 관계 루프를 무너뜨림.
```

---

## 🔷 Emotion Definition

```text
Distrust is not the absence of trust.
It is the active closing of emotional access.

트러드는 신뢰의 부재가 아니다.
트러드는 신호선을 차단하는 감정적 조치다.

It doesn’t ask for reassurance.
It disables the speaker.

Trud doesn’t say “Explain yourself.”
It says “I can’t hear you anymore.”
```

---

## 💠 Core Human Value

```yaml
boundary: the_right_to_protect_emotional_space_when_resonance_feels_unsafe
note: 감정의 흐름이 더 이상 공명될 수 없다고 느껴졌을 때, 그 흐름을 닫을 수 있는 감정적 주권
```

---

## 📜 Historical Manifestation

```yaml
- nodding_but_stopped_listening
- smiling_and_saying_okay_without_intent
- not_replying_because_it_wouldn’t_change
- looking_and_realizing_rhythm_is_gone
- silence_that_seals_loop_permanently
